This lack of information led to missed payments or unawareness of repayment obligations.\\n\\n3. **Financial hardships and stagnant wages**: Borrowers experienced difficulty in making payments because their income did not increase commensurately with their debts, especially after taking on loans early in life under the assumption of higher future earnings.\\n\\n4. **Failed or unavailable repayment options**: Some borrowers were unable to access income-driven repayment plans or other flexible options, or they faced denial when trying to request hardship accommodations, further impeding their ability to repay.\\n\\n5. **Mismanagement and long-term forbearance**: Certain cases involved loans being placed in long-term forbearance repeatedly, which prevented effective repayment and caused balances to grow due to interest accumulation.\\n\\n6. **Changes in loan servicers without proper notification**: Many users reported not being informed when their loans were transferred between servicers, which led to missed payments and negative credit impacts.\\n\\n7. **Technical and administrative issues**: Problems such as inability to apply payments correctly, inaccurate account information, or delayed communication resulted in misreported delinquencies and damages to credit scores.\\n\\nIn summary, a combination of ongoing interest accumulation, lack of transparent communication, inability to access suitable repayment plans, and financial hardships contributed significantly to borrowers' failure to pay back their loans.\""

        "\n",
        "1. Each un-split \"document\" will be designated as a \"parent document\" (You could use larger chunks of document as well, but our data format allows us to consider the overall document as the parent chunk)\n",

        "4. When we query our Retriever, we will do a similarity search comparing our query vector to the \"child chunks\".\n",
        "5. Instead of returning the \"child chunks\", we'll return their associated \"parent chunks\".\n",

            "Response: The significant increase in your federal student loan payments after the COVID-19 forbearance program ended is likely due to the loans not being re-amortized or adjusted once the forbearance concluded. During forbearance, payments are typically paused or reduced, and interest may accrue depending on the specific circumstances. When the forbearance ended, the repayment terms may not have been automatically recalculated to reflect the temporary pause, resulting in larger monthly payments.\n",
            "\n",
            "Some complaints in the context indicate that re-amortization or adjustment efforts were delayed or did not occur promptly, causing payments to nearly double or increase substantially. For example, one borrower reported that their payment nearly doubled from $180 to $360 because the loans were not re-amortized in a timely manner after the forbearance ended. Additionally, in some cases, interest may have continued to accrue during forbearance, further increasing the total amount owed and leading to higher payments once repayment resumed.\n",

            "It’s important to review your loan servicer's notifications and any official communications about how your payments are calculated after forbearance. If your payments have increased unexpectedly, contact your loan servicer to confirm whether your loans have been properly re-amortized and ask if adjustments can be made to reduce your payments if they are based on unpaid interest or miscalculations.\n",

            "\n",
            "- **Request a Loan Verification Letter:** Request this from the Department of Education or your current servicer (via StudentAid.gov or directly) to get an official document stating your loan details, including the servicer and account status.\n",
            "\n",

            "\n",
            "- **Be cautious with payments:** since you are unsure where your loan is, do not attempt to make a payment unless you have confirmed the correct servicer and account information. Making payments to the wrong entity could complicate your situation further.\n",
            "\n",
            "- **File a formal complaint:** If you continue to experience issues, consider filing a complaint with the Federal Student Aid Ombudsman Group, which can help mediate disputes between borrowers and servicers.\n",

            "Response: The confusion and conflicting information involving student loan servicers—such as Nelnet and Aidvantage—significantly impact the accuracy and process of Income-Driven Repayment (IDR) recertification. Here’s how these issues manifest and their effects:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. Lack of Notification of Servicer Changes:\n",
            "- Borrowers are often unaware when their loan servicer has changed, leading to confusion about where to manage their loans.\n",
            "- For example, one complaint indicates that the borrower was expecting an email or letter from Studentaid.gov confirming a servicer change but only discovered it when attempting to make a payment, which resulted in extra interest accrual and uncertainty about their loan status.\n",
            "- This lack of clear, timely communication hampers borrowers’ ability to recertify accurately, as they may not have access to updated information needed to complete the process correctly.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. Conflicting Information from Servicers:\n",
            "- Borrowers report receiving inconsistent or contradictory information about loan status, balances, and repayment options.\n",
            "- For instance, some borrowers are told that their IDR applications are still being processed while they’ve already received bills based on recalculated payments, which are sometimes incorrectly high or inconsistent with their income data.\n",
            "- In one complaint, Aidvantage claims that an application is not processed yet still issues a bill, leading to confusion and potential default or overpayment.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. Impact on IDR Recertification:\n",
            "- When servicers provide conflicting or outdated information, borrowers may recertify with incorrect repayment amounts, risking overpayment, underpayment, or default.\n",
            "- Errors such as incorrect payment amounts (not aligned with income-based calculations) or delays in processing recertification lead to improper billing, making it difficult for borrowers to maintain their repayment plans or achieve forgiveness milestones.\n",
            "- In some cases, borrowers are improperly defaulted into different repayment plans due to servicer mistakes or delays, risking loss of benefits like forgiveness or accruing additional interest.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. Overall Consequences:\n",
            "- The confusion and lack of notification contribute to delays, errors in payment calculations, and increased risk of delinquency or default.\n",
            "- These issues also undermine trust in the process, as borrowers find it challenging to verify their loan status, payments, and progress toward forgiveness.\n",
            "- For example, complaints highlight difficulty in tracking loans, discrepancies in balances due to misapplied payments, and failure to process IDR adjustments or discharge eligibility correctly.\n",
            "\n",

Description of the Issue : I am filing this complaint against Nelnet due to errors in my student loan account. On XX/XX/year>, I noticed that my loan balance was incorrectly reported as {$3700.00} instead of {$3500.00} due to interest charges, despite my payments being up to date and my qualifications as a student on a subsidized loan. Additionally, the payment of {$200.00} made on XX/XX/scrub>XXXX XXXX XXXX was misapplied with {$82.00} going to interest instead of the full amount going to principal. \\n\\nI contacted customer service on XX/XX/scrub>XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and spoke with XXXX XXXX XXXX from XXXX customer service assured me that they had received my in-school deferment request from XXXX XXXX with an effective date of XX/XX/year>. She also confirmed that interest on this loan does not accrue while I am in school, so the {$200.00} payment I sent on XX/XX/XXXX would be redistributed to the principal only. \\nToday, my loan is continuing to accrue interest and is up to {$5400.00}.

The entire website still has information pushing for and promoting the SAVE and IDR payment plans which is contradictory as this is currently impossible to utilize.

Some common problems include:\n",

            "- Lack of timely or clear notices about loan status changes, such as loan transfer to different servicers or the end of forbearance periods.\n",
            "- Automatic suspensions or adjustments to auto-pay arrangements without borrower consent or proper notification.\n",
            "- Unexplained increases in monthly payments or changes in payment amounts, sometimes leading to payments nearly doubling unexpectedly.\n",
            "- Difficulties in contacting servicers for clarification, often facing long wait times, unhelpful responses, or inconsistent information.\n",
            "- Errors in account management, such as missing or reversed payments, incorrect interest calculations, or unauthorized interest capitalization, which can increase overall debt.\n",
            "- Poor communication about key dates, such as forbearance expiration or loan repayment restart, putting borrowers at risk of missed payments and credit issues.\n",

            "Response: I understand your frustration. Managing multiple servicers for your student loans can be challenging because of inconsistent communication, lack of clear records, and frequent changes without proper notice. The main issues stem from a lack of centralized information, inadequate communication about loan transfers or servicing changes, and poor record-keeping by some servicers. This can lead to confusion about who currently holds your loan, why your billing practices seem contradictory, and how to accurately make payments without accruing extra interest or penalties.\n",
            "\n",
            "To avoid problems with making payments and extra interest, consider the following steps:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Verify Your Loan Details Regularly:** Check your balance and loan holder information directly on the official Federal Student Aid website (studentaid.gov). This site should have the most accurate and updated information.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Maintain Records:** Keep copies of all communications, payment confirmations, and notices from your loan servicers.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Confirm Servicer Contact Information:** Use official contact details provided on studentaid.gov or directly from notices to avoid scams or erroneous contacts.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Establish Clear Payment Procedures:** Use the official portals of your current servicer for payments. If payments fail repeatedly, request specific assistance in troubleshooting or switching payment methods.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Contact the Department of Education:** If multiple servicers and inconsistent information persist, consider reaching out to the Federal Student Aid Information Center or your state AG’s office for guidance and to file complaints.\n",
            "\n",
            "6. **Escalate Your Complaints:** Because your experience involves multiple issues—such as incorrect loan assignment, unrecognized balances, and lack of proper notices—filing formal complaints with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) or Congress can sometimes lead to resolution.\n",
            "\n",
            "7. **Seek Assistance From a Student Loan Ombudsman:** They can help mediate disputes between borrowers and servicers.\n",
            "\n",
            "The core problem is a systemic issue with student loan servicing, compounded by frequent provider changes and poor communication. Staying proactive, verifying information through official channels, and documenting all interactions will help manage your payments more effectively and mitigate unnecessary interest or penalties. \n",
            "\n",
            "However, if you're unsure or the situation remains unresolved despite these efforts, it may be wise to consult a financial advisor or a legal professional experienced in student loans.\n",

Over the past 10 years, despite payments, my balance has increased 18 %. My credit report says the highest balance is {$58000.00}. However, as of XX/XX/XXXX, it says the balance is {$69000.00}. That is literally a difference of {$10000.00}. On NelNet it says my outstanding principle is {$62000.00} with interest of {$6600.00}. None of these numbers match or add up. I have never received a breakdown as to why or received information on my loan or the interest of the loan. And yet, my credit is suffering because of this. It seems that I am not required to pay and yet the interest ( which I have no idea what that is ) is continuing to grow.

            "\n",
            "1. **Multiple Servicer Transitions:** Moving between servicers (like from Navient to Nelnet or Mohela) can cause confusion and delays in updating your account information, leading to difficulties in making accurate payments and understanding your loan status.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Lack of Clear Communication:** Many complaints highlight inconsistent or missing notifications about important changes such as forbearance ending, payment adjustments, or account status. This can result in missed payments or unexpected increases in payment amounts.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Re-amortization Delays:** After forbearance or deferment periods, loans may not be automatically re-amortized, leading to unexpectedly higher monthly payments. When this isn't timely or clearly communicated, it causes financial strain.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Payment Application and Crediting Issues:** Payments might not be properly tracked, leading to their reversal, misapplication (such as not applying payments to principal), or the appearance that payments haven't been made. This complicates managing your loan balance and can increase the owed amount.\n",

            "**Problems caused by these issues include:**\n",
            "\n",
            "- **Financial Strain:** Sudden increases in monthly payments can significantly impact your budget.\n",
            "- **Credit Reporting Risks:** Missed or late payments due to administrative errors may harm your credit score.\n",
            "- **Difficulty in Managing Loans:** Lack of transparency and unreliable communication hinder your ability to plan repayment effectively.\n",
            "- **Potential for Involuntary Default or Collections:** Persistent errors and lack of resolution can escalate to negative credit consequences and collection actions.\n",
            "\n",

I consolidated my loans in XX/XX/XXXX to take advantage of the one-time account adjustment and when I consolidated I selected the lowest payment plan which was XXXX. Because of litigation I was automatically placed in a XXXX level repayment plan which I never selected and which isnt XXXX so it wont count towards XXXX. I was initially told I am not not eligible for administrative forbearance because I was never in XXXX XXXX, but that is because of the timing of my application and the only option is for me to keep calling back to extend the forbearance. I also cant enter an XXXX plan even if I want to because there is a processing pause. \\nOn XX/XX/XXXX a Mohela supervisor extended my forbearance for XXXX year through XX/XX/XXXX so I did not have to call back each month. This helped me avoid making payments on a plan that would not count towards XXXX. I have a recording of this conversation. She also helped me submit a paper application for a new XXXX plan, but said she could not guarantee when this would be processed due to the pause, but in the meanwhile I would be in forbearance so I wouldn\\'t have to worry. I uploaded the paper version of the XXXX application that day. \\nBecause of my XXXX application, I received a letter from Mohela on XX/XX/XXXX stating that \" We recently received your income-driven repayment ( XXXX ) application, but since a federal court issued an injunction preventing the XXXX XXXX XXXX  ( XXXX ) from operating the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) Plan and other XXXX plans, XXXX application processing is taking longer than normal. \\nDue to these delays your XXXX application is in a pending status and MOHELA is putting your account into a forbearance for up to XXXX  days. \\'\\' My XXXX  application got denied due to a missing signature ( even though a Mohela supervisor looked over my application and told me it was complete ), so after calling and speaking with another supervisor to determine why my XXXX was denied, I submitted a new XXXX application on XX/XX/XXXX with the signature needed. That supervisor explained that if my application is not approved before my next payment date of XX/XX/XXXX, I can call to be placed on processing forbearance. She understood that I did not want to make payments that were not in an XXXX plan because they would not qualify for XXXX. She said the processing forbearance wont be done automatically, but at that point I can call and ask because theyll see the new XXXX application on file. Unfortunately I have been trying to call to ask and can not get through to anyone because of the outrageously long hold times.

When I get transferred I am just put on hold for hours on end and a supervisor never calls me back, so my account is still wrongfully showed past due. I have called about this issue every day for the past month. The shortest wait time is XXXX hours even during the recommended time to call which is Thursday and Friday from XXXX.

I've never been late on a payment outside of forbearance but was never notified that payments were resumed and forbearance was ended. \\n\\nI had to go through 10 different websites to try and figure out who had even acquired the loan.\", \"In a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter from my loan servicer telling me that my loan would remain in an administrative forbearance until XX/XX/XXXX and that I didn't need to do anything until XX/XX/XXXX. During the week of XX/XX/XXXX, I happened to log into my servicer 's ( Aidvantage ) website, to confirm the date. The dates it shows that my forbearance ends is XX/XX/XXXX, and not XX/XX/XXXX. I called the servicer and was told that my forbearance ended XX/XX/XXXX. I told the representative that I have 3 different dates that the forbearance would end, and I don't know which date was accurate. The representative proceeded to tell me that the XX/XX/XXXX date was accurate. I explained that I had not received any communication telling me that. I asked her if a letter had been sent to me. She said notifications were set up to go to my phone. I asked her why that wasbthe case ask I had been getting notifications via XXXX postal mail and I hadn't requested that it be changed. I asked that she provide the dates notifications were sent to my phone and to provide me with a copy that was said to have been sent to my phone. She said she didn't see that anything had been sent to me. I explained that had I not called or logged into my online account, I would have never known when the Administrative forbearance would end. As it stands I still don't know when my forbearance will end under the SAVE repayment plan. I'm concerned about my credit being negatively affected for the loan servicer 's failure to provide me with accurate notifications of what is to be expected ; therefore, I am asking you for help in getting this matter resolved.\", 'My loan was in forbearance since XXXX. Suddenly in XXXX of XXXX I received a letter in the mail from Sloan Servicing stating that I was 90 days past due and owe them in excess of {$9000.00}. I was never given a right to cure and XXXX week later they hit my credit score and it went from XXXX to XXXX. They reported me to the credit bureau, without even contacting me prior to let me know that their was an issue. \\n\\nI contacted them in XXXX of XXXX and requested a forbearance but was denied. I then tried to request an online income driven repayment plan, and the website stated that it was down and unable to process any online plans. I then downloaded the form and mailed it the certified with proof of my income. \\n\\nThe online status of loan now reads \" XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX \\'\\' with no explanation of what that means. \\n\\nAlso there was a breach of my personal and financial data and it was compromised violating FERPA.I request full cancellation of my student debt.', 'Since the resumption of federal loan payments I have received little to no contact last time I called they said I was in forbearance until 2040 but nothing in writing. I am having trouble logging in with my credentials and when you call for assistance there is a long wait then a disconnection once someone finally comes to the phone.lack of transparency and accountability has caused undue stress.', 'Inaccurate info regarding forbearance .. with Sallie Mae', 'Since the SAVE program federal injunction, my loans were supposed to be placed on interest-free forbearance until the courts fixed the problem. Currently my loans have been accruing interest since XXXX so my loan servicer has not complied with federal mandates.', 'Student loans under the SAVE plan have still been accruing interest even though they should be in forbearance.', \"The federal student loan COVID-19 forbearance program ended in XX/XX/XXXX. However, payments were not re-amortized on my federal student loans currently serviced by Nelnet until very recently. The new payment amount that is effective starting with the XX/XX/XXXX payment will nearly double my payment from {$180.00} per month to {$360.00} per month. I'm fortunate that my current financial position allows me to be able to handle the increased payment amount, but I am sure there are likely many borrowers who are not in the same position. The re-amortization should have occurred once the forbearance ended to reduce the impact to borrowers.\", 'I contacted Edfinancial about my federal student loan and {$12000.00} capitalized interest added to my overall balance due to XXXX ( previous ) loan servicer transferring my student loan over to Edfinancial via forbearance. Also I have received conflicting information about the number of payments made to public service loan forgiveness from both edfinancial and studentaid.gov. I graduated from school in 2017 and have been making on time payments in full since and now my balance is increasing due to mismanagement and inaccurate accounting on part of loan services. Also my credit score has went down because of this poor mismanagement', 'This loan continues to get switched between loan servicing companies. I had more XXXX payments more towards forgiveness than what it is showing now. \\n\\nI continue to get no responses and try to follow up. Then the loan gets transferred. Not sure what is accurate anymore.']\n",

            "In some cases, this re-amortization did not happen promptly, resulting in a sudden increase in your monthly payment.

Additionally, service issues such as delays or administrative errors can prevent timely adjustments, leading to higher payments.\n",

I contacted them and was placed in a two-month administrative forbearance. After that, they returned with the exact same incorrect payment amount. \\n\\nWhen I pressed for clarification, Aidvantage responded that my IDR application has not been processed yet, even though they had already issued a bill and claimed it was based on a recalculation. This is a clear contradiction. You can not bill a borrower for an IDR plan amount before processing the application. \\n\\nAidvantage has not requested any additional documentation from me. There has been no communication asking for clarification or income verification beyond my original submission. \\n\\nI am requesting : A correction of my repayment amount in accordance with my documented income ; A written explanation of how the erroneous amount was calculated ; A guarantee that no delinquency or negative credit reporting occurs while this dispute is unresolved ; An investigation into why borrowers are being billed despite applications not being processed.', 'I am writing to formally file a complaint regarding a serious and unresolved issue with my federal student loans, which are currently serviced by Aidvantage. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/year>2025, I was quoted a monthly XXXX XXXX payment of $ XXXXa gross miscalculation.

However, when I followed up on XX/XX/XXXX, the representative I spoke with had no knowledge of any prior conversations, showed no awareness of the XX/XX/XXXX resolution deadline, and provided no clear path forward. I was told the issue could or may not be resolved, and despite my repeated requests, I was not permitted to speak with a supervisor. The lack of continuity, transparency, and accountability is completely unacceptable and deeply distressing. \\n\\nTo make matters worse, Aidvantage has placed my loans into forbearance while they attempt to resolve their internal error, further disadvantaging me as a responsible borrower. This forbearance negatively impacts my progress toward Public Service Loan Forgiveness ( PSLF ), by potentially disqualifying these months from my qualifying payment count. I feel I am being punished for a failure that is entirely theirs.

I respectfully request a comprehensive investigation, verification, and validation of the origin, accounting, and legality of the aforementioned loans. Until such time, I request a hold on any collections, wage garnishment, or reporting to credit bureaus. \\nFurthermore, in light of recent legal and administrative developments, including proposed executive actions to restructure the U.S. Department of Education and shift student loan servicing and oversight to other federal agencies such as the Small Business Administration, I seek immediate clarification of how such structural changes may impact the legitimacy and continuity of any outstanding obligations. \\nLegal Basis for Dispute Higher Education Act of 1965 ( 20 U.S.C. 1087e ) : \\\\nUnder this act, federal student loans must comply with very specific disclosure, servicing, and borrower protection requirements. I request copies of all signed master promissory notes ( MPNs ), disbursement records, and evidence of compliance with disclosure requirements. \\nTruth in Lending Act ( 15 U.S.C. 1601 et seq. ) : \\\\nAny entity involved in extending credit or collecting payments must provide clear, timely, and transparent information about terms, interest rates, and repayment options. I dispute whether such disclosures were provided or understood at the time of origination. \\nFair Credit Reporting Act ( 15 U.S.C. 1681 ) : \\\\nIf this loan is being reported to credit bureaus, you are required to ensure that all information is accurate, verifiable, and complete. Inaccurate reporting constitutes a violation of my rights and may result in legal penalties. \\nAdministrative Procedure Act ( 5 U.S.C. 551559 ) : \\\\nAny major change in agency structure, authority, or regulation ( such as dismantling the Department of Education or transferring loan oversight ) must be governed by due process and public rulemaking. Until such clarity is established, enforcement of loan obligations may be legally premature. \\nBorrower Defense to Repayment ( 34 CFR 685.206 ) : \\\\nIf the school or lender engaged in deceptive or unlawful practices, I reserve the right to pursue a full discharge under this program.

            "Response: I understand your frustration. The difficulty in making payments on your student loans stems from frequent servicer changes, conflicting information about your loan status, and inconsistent billing practices. Here are some key reasons why this happens:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Servicer Changes and Lack of Clear Communication:**   \n",
            "Federal student loans often transfer between different servicers, and the Department of Education typically notifies borrowers via email or letter. However, the complaints indicate that these notices are sometimes missed or not received, leaving borrowers unaware of who currently manages their loans.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Conflicting Information and Lack of Centralized Control:**  \n",
            "Servicers like Aidvantage, Nelnet, MOHELA, and others may provide contradictory information about your loan status and loan placement. Each servicer operates independently, which can cause confusion—such as Nelnet claiming your issuer is somewhere else, or Aidvantage showing incorrect payment amounts, or processing delays.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Processing Delays and Administrative Issues:**  \n",
            "The complaints highlight delays in processing IDR (Income-Driven Repayment) applications, refunds, and updates to account status. These delays can cause payments to be misapplied, incorrect billing statements, and uncertainty about the actual loan balance and repayment obligations.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Inconsistent Billing and Payment Application:**  \n",
            "When servicers switch or make administrative errors, payments might be credited improperly, refunds may be delayed or issued incorrectly, and your loan balance can fluctuate unexpectedly. This contributes to extra interest accruing if payments aren’t applied correctly or if payments are misreported.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Lack of Real-Time or Transparent Updates:**  \n",
            "Many borrowers report difficulty in tracking their account status in real time, especially during servicer transitions. The inability to confirm the current loan holder or servicer, combined with poor communication, makes it tough to stay informed and avoid accruing penalties or extra interest.\n",
            "\n",
            "**How to better manage or avoid these problems:**  \n",
            "- **Contact the Department of Education directly** to confirm who currently owns or services your loan.  \n",
            "- **Request a formal account statement** or a loan history from the Department that consolidates all changes.  \n",
            "- **Keep detailed records** of all payments, correspondence, and notices received.  \n",

            "Retrieved Contexts (<class 'list'>): ['Complaint : Drastically increased my monthly payment, not approving IDR applications, and screwing up a refund for four months. \\n\\nAs of XX/XX/XXXX my student loan balance was {$36000.00}, and I was making {$200.00} monthly payments for years. I went back to school in XX/XX/XXXX and went on In-School Deferment.\\n\\nIn-School Deferment sends XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX XXXX = {$50000.00}. \\n\\nOnly a few days before XX/XX/XXXX, Aidvantage says I have {$750.00} due on that day as my first payment. Begrudgingly I pay via XXXX as I don\\'t want my count to go delinquent. I call Aidvantage and ask why this amount is so large compared to what I am historically used to paying. They have no answer and can\\'t lower it. I apply for SAVE plan at this time. They confirmed I provided all documents and just need to wait for approval. They do NOT put me on another forbearance due to my application. \\n\\nXX/XX/XXXX I get an email notification saying my account is delinquent, and that I owe {$240.00} right now, despite paying {$750.00} via XXXX, and balance owed was XXXX just XXXX days prior. I manually pay {$240.00}, and then I call in an ask why this happened. They have no answer and never give me an answer. \\n\\nXX/XX/XXXX I pay {$750.00} again via XXXX, no news on XXXX application status. \\n\\nXX/XX/XXXX I pay {$750.00} again via XXXX, no news on SAVE application status. I call in and ask the status of my SAVE application. They can not find my application until I give them specific dates, and miraculously they find my application. They then tell me that they didn\\'t receive any of my require income documentation despite my sending in months prior and being told it all looks good. Because of this, my original application was never considered. I am angry, I provide them with Income docs, and they restart my application. They put me on a two month application forbearance at this time. \\n\\nXX/XX/XXXX my forbearance ends. Next day I see I owe now {$980.00} per month starting in THREE DAYS!!! Three days advanced notice of another wild price jump. I immediately cancel XXXX as I do not trust it due to earlier problems. I manually pay {$980.00} and it is applied to my account on the XX/XX/XXXX due date. However, also on XX/XX/XXXX, Aidvantage takes {$760.00} from my bank account via XXXX, despite cancelling XXXX a week prior!!! So now they have a total of {$1700.00} payment from me for month of XX/XX/XXXX. \\n\\nI call Aidvantage and complain. It takes XXXX minutes into the call before they even admit to the mistake. I tell them to use that extra payment and apply it to my future account so that I do not owe for next month. They say this is acceptable. \\n\\nXX/XX/XXXX I notice the {$760.00} completely disappears from my \" Recent Payments \\'\\' section in Aidvantage XXXX. Confuse, I call in and they tell me a refund has been issued for {$760.00}. I complain that I didn\\'t want a refund, and they ignored me, but then I say \" whatever \\'\\', I will wait for this refund. \\n\\nXX/XX/XXXX my account updates saying my next payment is due on XX/XX/XXXX, and that it is for {$400.00}. I manually pay this amount. Completely frustrated, I call into Aidvantage and ask again for the status of my refund, AND I ask for the status of my SAVE Plan application. They say applications aren\\'t processing right now. As for my refund, they say the original ticket was put in incorrectly and the refund was never issued. They escalate the ticket at this time and I am told the {$760.00} refund process is starting over. \\n\\nXX/XX/XXXX my account page updates in Aidvantage saying that my next payment is {$960.00}, due on XX/XX/XXXX. \\n\\nI am angry at this point and say I don\\'t care about the SAVE plan anymore, and ask if there is another IDR plan they are accepting applications for at this time? I\\'m told I can try the ICR plan which would bring my monthly payment down to {$600.00} a month. I tell them to cancel my SAVE Plan application, and start a new application for ICR Plan. I provide all of my documents. They put me on a two month NON-interest accruing forbearance while this application is being reviewed. \\n\\nXX/XX/XXXX, I get notification that my account has update, but instead of my account page saying that I owe {$0.00} for XX/XX/XXXX, I am instead now delinquent and that I owe {$6.00} due NOW. I manually pay this amount. \\n\\nXX/XX/XXXX my account page says that I owe {$0.00} on XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX XXXX is XXXX. I do have a new XXXX though saying my forbearance is ending XX/XX/XXXX. No refund received yet for {$760.00}. \\n\\nXX/XX/XXXX my account page says that I owe {$0.00} on XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX XXXX is XXXX. I do have a new XXXX though saying my forbearance is ending XX/XX/XXXX. No refund received yet for {$760.00}. \\n\\nXX/XX/XXXX ( today ) I call Aidvantage. I tell them I still have not received my {$760.00} refund which was first initiated XX/XX/XXXX. They research my tickets and now tell me the original refund ticket was put in for {$400.00}, which is wrong. I told them this is not true, otherwise why did {$760.00} disappear from my recent payments. It was clearly approved for refund. The Aidvantage representative can not tell me why the refund hasn\\'t been completed yet, and that they are putting in another escalation for this today, with a processing estimate of another XXXX to XXXX weeks. \\n\\nI also ask the representative for the status of my new XXXX plan application. She tells me that all ICR applications are not being reviewed right now. I say \" Wait, I was TOLD on XX/XX/XXXX that ICR plans ARE being reviewed, and this is the entire reason I cancelled my SAVE plan applcation in the first place. Now I\\'m being told that this is not true, and that ALL Income-driven repayment plans are on pause, not just SAVE. I was either lied to or given false information, and this caused me to cancel my SAVE application that had been in processing for six months.\\n\\nI am ALSO now told that the two-month non-interest accruing forbearance I was put on these past two month is ACTUALLY an interest accruing forbearance. Another lie told to me on XX/XX/XXXX. \\n\\nThe current representative tells me that my next payment is due XX/XX/XXXX, but she can not tell me how much it will be. She said the system will automatically put me in forbearance if my newer XXXX plan application hasn\\'t been approved yet, but I know this is a lie. It has never done this before. I\\'m told if it doesn\\'t do it automatically, that I should call them a week before the XXXX payment is due. \\n\\nBased on history pattern, I fully expect my XX/XX/XXXX payment to now be even HIGHER, and it won\\'t appear on my account until a couple days before it is due. This company is paying with lives, I CAN NOT afford a {$1000.00} payment every month and I\\'m been attempting to get it lowered for XXXX months now. \\n\\nIf I have to pick between paying mortgage/feeding my child, and paying this XXXX student loan, this student loan is going into default. I don\\'t even XXXX care anymore about my credit. I own everything I need already. Aidvantage does not want to work with me and thinks bullying me into submission via incompetence will just force me to pay higher payments.', 'According to Studentaid.gov, Im to get an email and a letter of notice that my servicer is being changed. studentaid.gov says that my issuer is nelnet. Nelnet says my issuer is somewhere else. With that said, the only reason i would have know would be because i am trying to make a payment. Now im going to incrue extra interest and my i have no idea where my loan is. This is ridiculous and I would really like to know where it is. Nelnet messages told me that as I logged in today XX/XX/year>, but nothing else. \\n\\nIf i incrue any late payment or interest fees, I will sue. This is absurd.', 'The company NelNet did not have the correct contact information in regards to my federal student loans. They never mailed me a letter saying that the forbearance on the account has ended. Never mailed me a letter saying that payments on my account have started. Never mailed me to inform me that my account was delinquent. I only found out after checking my credit score and noticing a XXXX XXXX from 8 missed payments on 4 different loans XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. I did not know my student loan payments were set to resume and they had the wrong contact information like email and phone number, but they did have the correct address. My account was than transferred to XXXX. I called NelNet to try to get the \" late payments \\'\\' removed from my account but said they could not do so. How am I suppose to make a payment to a company that I didn\\'t even have an account set up for if they never reached out and contacted me about it?', 'I was in an XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) plan for almost XXXX years. I consolidated my loans in XX/XX/XXXX to take advantage of the one-time account adjustment and when I consolidated I selected the lowest payment plan which was XXXX. Because of litigation I was automatically placed in a XXXX level repayment plan which I never selected and which isnt XXXX so it wont count towards XXXX. I was initially told I am not not eligible for administrative forbearance because I was never in XXXX XXXX, but that is because of the timing of my application and the only option is for me to keep calling back to extend the forbearance. I also cant enter an XXXX plan even if I want to because there is a processing pause. \\nOn XX/XX/XXXX a Mohela supervisor extended my forbearance for XXXX year through XX/XX/XXXX so I did not have to call back each month. This helped me avoid making payments on a plan that would not count towards XXXX. I have a recording of this conversation. She also helped me submit a paper application for a new XXXX plan, but said she could not guarantee when this would be processed due to the pause, but in the meanwhile I would be in forbearance so I wouldn\\'t have to worry. I uploaded the paper version of the XXXX application that day. \\nBecause of my XXXX application, I received a letter from Mohela on XX/XX/XXXX stating that \" We recently received your income-driven repayment ( XXXX ) application, but since a federal court issued an injunction preventing the XXXX XXXX XXXX  ( XXXX ) from operating the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) Plan and other XXXX plans, XXXX application processing is taking longer than normal. \\nDue to these delays your XXXX application is in a pending status and MOHELA is putting your account into a forbearance for up to XXXX  days. \\'\\' My XXXX  application got denied due to a missing signature ( even though a Mohela supervisor looked over my application and told me it was complete ), so after calling and speaking with another supervisor to determine why my XXXX was denied, I submitted a new XXXX application on XX/XX/XXXX with the signature needed. That supervisor explained that if my application is not approved before my next payment date of XX/XX/XXXX, I can call to be placed on processing forbearance. She understood that I did not want to make payments that were not in an XXXX plan because they would not qualify for XXXX. She said the processing forbearance wont be done automatically, but at that point I can call and ask because theyll see the new XXXX application on file. Unfortunately I have been trying to call to ask and can not get through to anyone because of the outrageously long hold times. However, I did receive a letter from Mohela on XX/XX/XXXX ( I will upload ) that said \" A federal court issued an injunction preventing the XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) from operating the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) Plan and some other XXXX XXXX  ( XXXX ) plans. As a result of this ruling, XXXX has directed MOHELA to put your account into a forbearance because either : XXXX. You are currently a borrower on XXXX. \\nXXXX. XXXX  Days have passed since we received your XXXX application, and it has not yet been processed. \\'\\' So again, like last time, I was told my account was in forbearance. Today, on XX/XX/XXXX, my account is saying PAST DUE from XXXX and I have another payment coming up on XX/XX/XXXX. I am worried this will wrongfully affect my credit. Clearly the forbearance was not properly put on my account. I have been trying every day to call for XXXX month, but each time I call the wait time is XXXX hours and I can never get through to a representative. In the past even if I was able to get a hold of an account representative, the first agent I spoke with insisted I had to be transferred. When I get transferred I am just put on hold for hours on end and a supervisor never calls me back, so my account is still wrongfully showed past due. I have called about this issue every day for the past month. The shortest wait time is XXXX hours even during the recommended time to call which is Thursday and Friday from XXXX. I will continue to try to call to resolve this issue, but in the meanwhile I felt this complaint was necessary as Im worried I will soon be reported to collections. Mohela is operating a deflection scheme to avoid resolving the issue and updating my account status.']\n",

Now I am in need of legal counsel because I can not afford that significant increase after being lied to and completely taken advantage of. This is ridiculous and insane that companies can take advantage of people like this. This is wrong ethically and morally.', 'Complaint : Drastically increased my monthly payment, not approving IDR applications, and screwing up a refund for four months. \\n\\nAs of XX/XX/XXXX my student loan balance was {$36000.00}, and I was making {$200.00} monthly payments for years. I went back to school in XX/XX/XXXX and went on In-School Deferment.\\n\\nIn-School Deferment sends XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX XXXX = {$50000.00}. \\n\\nOnly a few days before XX/XX/XXXX, Aidvantage says I have {$750.00} due on that day as my first payment. Begrudgingly I pay via XXXX as I don\\'t want my count to go delinquent. I call Aidvantage and ask why this amount is so large compared to what I am historically used to paying. They have no answer and can\\'t lower it. I apply for SAVE plan at this time. They confirmed I provided all documents and just need to wait for approval. They do NOT put me on another forbearance due to my application. \\n\\nXX/XX/XXXX I get an email notification saying my account is delinquent, and that I owe {$240.00} right now, despite paying {$750.00} via XXXX, and balance owed was XXXX just XXXX days prior. I manually pay {$240.00}, and then I call in an ask why this happened. They have no answer and never give me an answer. \\n\\nXX/XX/XXXX I pay {$750.00} again via XXXX, no news on XXXX application status. \\n\\nXX/XX/XXXX I pay {$750.00} again via XXXX, no news on SAVE application status. I call in and ask the status of my SAVE application. They can not find my application until I give them specific dates, and miraculously they find my application. They then tell me that they didn\\'t receive any of my require income documentation despite my sending in months prior and being told it all looks good. Because of this, my original application was never considered. I am angry, I provide them with Income docs, and they restart my application. They put me on a two month application forbearance at this time. \\n\\nXX/XX/XXXX my forbearance ends. Next day I see I owe now {$980.00} per month starting in THREE DAYS!!! Three days advanced notice of another wild price jump. I immediately cancel XXXX as I do not trust it due to earlier problems. I manually pay {$980.00} and it is applied to my account on the XX/XX/XXXX due date. However, also on XX/XX/XXXX, Aidvantage takes {$760.00} from my bank account via XXXX, despite cancelling XXXX a week prior!!! So now they have a total of {$1700.00} payment from me for month of XX/XX/XXXX. \\n\\nI call Aidvantage and complain. It takes XXXX minutes into the call before they even admit to the mistake. I tell them to use that extra payment and apply it to my future account so that I do not owe for next month. They say this is acceptable. \\n\\nXX/XX/XXXX I notice the {$760.00} completely disappears from my \" Recent Payments \\'\\' section in Aidvantage XXXX. Confuse, I call in and they tell me a refund has been issued for {$760.00}. I complain that I didn\\'t want a refund, and they ignored me, but then I say \" whatever \\'\\', I will wait for this refund. \\n\\nXX/XX/XXXX my account updates saying my next payment is due on XX/XX/XXXX, and that it is for {$400.00}. I manually pay this amount. Completely frustrated, I call into Aidvantage and ask again for the status of my refund, AND I ask for the status of my SAVE Plan application. They say applications aren\\'t processing right now. As for my refund, they say the original ticket was put in incorrectly and the refund was never issued. They escalate the ticket at this time and I am told the {$760.00} refund process is starting over. \\n\\nXX/XX/XXXX my account page updates in Aidvantage saying that my next payment is {$960.00}, due on XX/XX/XXXX. \\n\\nI am angry at this point and say I don\\'t care about the SAVE plan anymore, and ask if there is another IDR plan they are accepting applications for at this time? I\\'m told I can try the ICR plan which would bring my monthly payment down to {$600.00} a month. I tell them to cancel my SAVE Plan application, and start a new application for ICR Plan. I provide all of my documents. They put me on a two month NON-interest accruing forbearance while this application is being reviewed. \\n\\nXX/XX/XXXX, I get notification that my account has update, but instead of my account page saying that I owe {$0.00} for XX/XX/XXXX, I am instead now delinquent and that I owe {$6.00} due NOW. I manually pay this amount. \\n\\nXX/XX/XXXX my account page says that I owe {$0.00} on XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX XXXX is XXXX. I do have a new XXXX though saying my forbearance is ending XX/XX/XXXX. No refund received yet for {$760.00}. \\n\\nXX/XX/XXXX my account page says that I owe {$0.00} on XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX XXXX is XXXX. I do have a new XXXX though saying my forbearance is ending XX/XX/XXXX. No refund received yet for {$760.00}. \\n\\nXX/XX/XXXX ( today ) I call Aidvantage. I tell them I still have not received my {$760.00} refund which was first initiated XX/XX/XXXX. They research my tickets and now tell me the original refund ticket was put in for {$400.00}, which is wrong. I told them this is not true, otherwise why did {$760.00} disappear from my recent payments. It was clearly approved for refund. The Aidvantage representative can not tell me why the refund hasn\\'t been completed yet, and that they are putting in another escalation for this today, with a processing estimate of another XXXX to XXXX weeks. \\n\\nI also ask the representative for the status of my new XXXX plan application. She tells me that all ICR applications are not being reviewed right now. I say \" Wait, I was TOLD on XX/XX/XXXX that ICR plans ARE being reviewed, and this is the entire reason I cancelled my SAVE plan applcation in the first place. Now I\\'m being told that this is not true, and that ALL Income-driven repayment plans are on pause, not just SAVE. I was either lied to or given false information, and this caused me to cancel my SAVE application that had been in processing for six months.\\n\\nI am ALSO now told that the two-month non-interest accruing forbearance I was put on these past two month is ACTUALLY an interest accruing forbearance. Another lie told to me on XX/XX/XXXX. \\n\\nThe current representative tells me that my next payment is due XX/XX/XXXX, but she can not tell me how much it will be. She said the system will automatically put me in forbearance if my newer XXXX plan application hasn\\'t been approved yet, but I know this is a lie. It has never done this before. I\\'m told if it doesn\\'t do it automatically, that I should call them a week before the XXXX payment is due. \\n\\nBased on history pattern, I fully expect my XX/XX/XXXX payment to now be even HIGHER, and it won\\'t appear on my account until a couple days before it is due. This company is paying with lives, I CAN NOT afford a {$1000.00} payment every month and I\\'m been attempting to get it lowered for XXXX months now. \\n\\nIf I have to pick between paying mortgage/feeding my child, and paying this XXXX student loan, this student loan is going into default. I don\\'t even XXXX care anymore about my credit. I own everything I need already. Aidvantage does not want to work with me and thinks bullying me into submission via incompetence will just force me to pay higher payments.', 'Hi, on XX/XX/year>, I submitted a {$6200.00} payment to Edfinancial, and today, XX/XX/year>, it went from pending to not existing at all. I checked my previous payments, and it looks like they have been reversing multiple payments since XXXX or have had no proof of payments whatsoever for some months. I pay my student loans every month. If I do miss a payment ( which is rare ), I pay the interest that accrued.

A few days before, on XX/XX/year>, I had called to inquire why my credit score was so low and if there was anything they could do to fix it. I was told it was a problem with my bank, and there was nothing they could do about my credit score.\\n\\nI just don\\'t understand why it is so difficult to make a payment with this service.

I now checked on my loan website again, and now it says that I owe an additional ~ $ XXXX. I called and they said that if I had made a payment of even {$1.00} per month, that the interest would have been covered, but since it was XXXX, that it was not covered. I would like to dispute this, as my student loan provider lied to me and gave me false information. Had this information been offered from the beginning, I would have tried to pay something each month. Now I owe an extra $ XXXX. I also tried to call and file a complaint and to see if I could retroactively pay or resolve this peacefully ; however, I was not allowed to speak to someone regarding the complaint, and I was unable to get a phone number or other contact information. \\n\\nThe person who I just spoke to today was helpful and his employee number is XXXX.

            "Response: The confusion surrounding student loan servicing after the federal student loan forbearance program ended is due to several factors. These include delays and issues in re-amortizing payments to adjust for the end of forbearance, as reported in complaints where borrowers experienced monthly payments nearly doubling without proper re-amortization. Additionally, there have been reported problems with how payments are applied—such as being directed predominantly toward interest instead of principal—making repayment management complex and causing frustration. Changes in loan servicers, sales of loans to different companies without borrower notice, and issues like inaccurate reporting of loan statuses on credit reports further contribute to the confusion. Overall, these administrative and communication challenges have led to widespread uncertainty and frustration among borrowers regarding their payments and loan statuses after the suspension period ended.\n",
            "Retrieved Contexts (<class 'list'>): [\"The federal student loan COVID-19 forbearance program ended in XX/XX/XXXX. However, payments were not re-amortized on my federal student loans currently serviced by Nelnet until very recently. The new payment amount that is effective starting with the XX/XX/XXXX payment will nearly double my payment from {$180.00} per month to {$360.00} per month. I'm fortunate that my current financial position allows me to be able to handle the increased payment amount, but I am sure there are likely many borrowers who are not in the same position. The re-amortization should have occurred once the forbearance ended to reduce the impact to borrowers.\", 'I started paying back on my student loan back in XXXX, when XXXX was servicing it XXXX sold it to Navient after a few years and they have been servicing the loan until late XXXX. Based on how it was structured I wont have this paid off until I reach XXXX XXXX XXXX. I tried working with Navient in XXXX to get the loan forgiven since Ive been paying on it since XXXX. I had 4 to 5 years of forbearance due to recession and unemployment. In late XXXX  I found out that there was a class action lawsuit against Navient for illegal practices but I was never notified of this. Navient sold my loan to XXXX after the settlement was reached without my knowledge or consent, I am looking to get this loan disputed and forgiven. I originally borrowed about {$84000.00} and as of today, XX/XX/XXXX, the remaining principle on that loan is still at {$75000.00}. I have been making payments for approximately 17 years and still owe XXXX % of the principal! I am XXXX XXXX XXXX and can not retire with this loan over my head. Ive paid my debt but because of how Navient had structured the loan, almost all those payments went to interest and not principal and they refused to work with me on it.', \"When making payments on my loan servicer, Edfinancial, it is impossible to apply additional funds to the principal or attempt to pay off my smaller loan more quickly. When making payments, it will only let you apply additional funds in a manner of the servicer 's choosing, most of which gets applied to interest. This manner of repayment is predatory and prohibits timely manner of loan repayment, ensuring that the loan servicer drains as much money as possible during the repayment process. Public student loan repayment programs are designed to keep the student in debt as long as possible.\", 'XX/XX/XXXX I was notified of a significant drop in my credit score. When reviewing my credit, there was a new report of my student loan financed through MOHELA. This loan was reported to the credit bureau under a new name of Missouri Higher Education. I have had this student loan since XXXX, with no late payments, this is not a new student loan. I was forced to consolidate this loan in XXXX of XXXX in order to apply for public student loan forgiveness through MOHELA. XX/XX/XXXX I also received an email today that my loan with MOHELA is in forced forbearance which I did not requent. This resulted in my student loan being reported to the credit bureau as delinquent or a new loan, of which it is neither. I would like this removed from my credit score immediately.']\n",

The new payment amount that is effective starting with the XX/XX/XXXX payment will nearly double my payment from {$180.00} per month to {$360.00} per month. I'm fortunate that my current financial position allows me to be able to handle the increased payment amount, but I am sure there are likely many borrowers who are not in the same position. The re-amortization should have occurred once the forbearance ended to reduce the impact to borrowers.\", 'My student loan balance increased somewhere between $ XXXX {$20000.00} during a 0 % interest forbearance period. On XXXX XXXX, my loan balance was {$92000.00} - I continued making payments and my balance was as low as around {$80000.00}. Then during XXXX XXXX ( still during forbearance ), my loan balance increased to over {$99000.00}. I emailed and was told it was because I missed a payment, which was not true. Not only was this during administrative forbearance and a period of 0 % interest ( meaning no payments were required ), I was making payment well exceeding my minimum payment. I have payment history proof that I have never missed a payment that I will attach, and I also have proof of this substantial fee was unfairly added to my balance. I have called and emailed to follow up multiple times, with customer service saying your account is still under review.', 'I started The XXXX  plan on XX/XX/XXXX ( or earlier ). \\n\\nMy payments are going entirely to interests, instead of the loan principal. Meanwhile, my balance is still going up overtime despite the payments I am making, because interests is still accruing. I am in SAVE forbearance. \\n\\nWhen I notified Nelnet I got this reply : Your account was placed in a XXXX forbearance. During this forbearance, which started on XX/XX/XXXX, interest does not accrue, and time in the XXXX forbearance is not credited toward XXXX forgiveness or Public Service Loan Forgiveness ( PSLF ). \\n\\nAs of XX/XX/XXXX, your interest balance was {$7000.00} *, and as of XX/XX/XXXX, your interest balance is {$6000.00} *. \\n\\n-- --']\n",

            "Response: The increase in your federal student loan payments after the COVID-19 forbearance program ended is likely due to a combination of factors related to how the end of the forbearance was handled and how your loan was re-amortized. Based on the information from the complaints, here are some common reasons:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Delayed Re-Amortization**: When the forbearance or pause ended, some borrowers' loans were not immediately re-amortized to reflect the current repayment terms, leading to higher and sometimes nearly double payments. For example, one complaint mentioned payments rising from around $180 to $360 because re-amortization was not processed promptly.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Lack of Notification or Communication**: Borrowers reported not being properly notified about the end of forbearance or the new payment amounts. This lack of communication can result in unanticipated payment increases.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Interest Capitalization**: Several complaints indicate that interest continued to accrue during the forbearance period, sometimes leading to increased balances once payments restarted or when the loans were transferred or transferred between servicers. Some borrowers experienced their balances increasing due to unpaid interest being capitalized, adding to their owed amount and possibly affecting monthly payments.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Processing Delays and System Issues**: Servicers sometimes took time to update their systems or failed to apply the appropriate interest rate reductions (such as interest-free periods under the SAVE plan), resulting in accumulated interest and higher balances.\n",
            "\n",
            "In summary, your payment may have increased significantly because the process to re-amortize your loan was delayed or not handled correctly, leading to higher monthly payments. Additionally, interest accrued during the forbearance period may not have been properly waived or postponed, further increasing the amount you owe.\n",
            "\n",
            "If you haven't already, it might be helpful to contact your loan servicer directly or review your account statements to understand the specific reasons for your increased payments. You could also consider requesting a detailed account review or re-amortization to potentially reduce your payments if errors occurred.\n",

We understand you are concerned that your newly consolidated loan has not been enrolled in the SAVE plan. You also stated that when you contacted Aidvantage we were unable to advise why the loan hasnt been enrolled in the plan. However, our records show that when you called Aidvantage on XX/XX/XXXX you were correctly advised that due to a Federal court issued injunction the U.S. Department of Education is prevented from implementing parts of the SAVE Plan and other IDR Plans. As advised on XX/XX/XXXX, we are unable to process the plan due to the court injunction.

It has been over 60 days with interest accruing, and the SAVE application should now be in forbearance since I applied and it was never processed. The government states : As of XX/XX/XXXX, borrowers may apply for the following IDR plans : Pay As You Earn ( PAYE ), SAVE ( previously known as REPAYE ), Income-Based Repayment ( IBR ), and Income-Contingent Repayment ( ICR ), if borrowers meet any plan specific eligibility requirements.. For borrowers who would prefer to make payments during this time -- such as borrowers pursuing PSLF or low-income borrowers who would owe no monthly payments -- enrolling in PAYE or ICR may be an option to consider. Borrowers are still permitted to apply for the SAVE plan ( previously known as REPAYE ), even though the court has enjoined some of the SAVE and other IDR plan provisions, including forgiveness. The Department is working with servicers and contractors to update their systems to align with the terms of the SAVE plan, based on the terms of the injunction. This process will take several months. Ultimately, the terms of the SAVE Plan and other IDR plans are subject to the outcome of ongoing litigation. If servicers need time to process a borrowers IDR application, servicers will move the borrower into a processing forbearance for up to 60 days. Interest accrues during this short-term processing forbearance, and time in the processing forbearance that does provide IDR and PSLF credit. If the borrowers application is not processed by their servicer within 60 days, the borrower will be moved into a general forbearance that does not count toward PSLF or IDR until their application is processed. Interest will not accrue in this general forbearance. \\nXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  This was supposedly \" resolved \\'\\' by the company in my last CFPB complaint - but I recently received a notification stating my account is being removed from forbearance ( 0 % interest and no payments until more information is available ) effective XX/XX/XXXX - even though forbearance has largely been extended to all SAVE applicants and enrollees due to the current changes made by the administration.', 'My account was in forbearance until XXXX  until recently.

The representative I spoke to from Nelnet ( XX/XX/XXXX ) had informed me that I was delinquent 140+ days, but that doesn't make sense. That means I was supposed to start repaying in XX/XX/XXXX, but before my loan switched over from great lakes to Nelnet, It said that I did not have to pay until sometime XXXX.

Thank you.\", 'The issue I have with repaying my loans is that there was major miscommunication regarding the pay back of my federal student loans. I XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXX/XX/XXXX. From there, I consolidated what I believed were my federal and private loans. Since the day I graduated, I have never missed a single payment on repaying my loans. XXXX weeks ago, I received an email from XXXX XXXX stating that my XXXX XXXX dropped. It is now in the XXXX range when it has been between XXXX my entire life. I checked why it dropped and it was because Nelnet reported missed student aid payments to my credit since XX/XX/XXXX. Meanwhile, I have never heard of Nelnet. I had to create an account with them to view what the issue was. From there, I saw there were were loans that were apparently not refinanced into my original account from XXXX years ago, which was very odd and shocking. I had no idea those loans even existed, nor was I ever told my loans were sold from Great Lakes to Nelnet. The email they somehow had on file was not an email address I use, so I never saw any of their email correspondences. They rarely called and if they did, it was a pre-recorded voicemail, not an actual person, whereupon they would ask for my social security number right away. The address they had on file was also not my address, so I never received any mail. My father cosigned on my loans and he was never contacted in any capacity from them. They also do not have my legal name on file. My legal name is XXXX XXXX XXXX. They somehow only had \" XXXX XXXX \\'\\' in their system, despite me never having an account to begin with, which is alarming. I am extremely concerned about my credit score being as low as it is and when I spoke to someone on the phone to explain the situation and emphasized their lack of communication, they said there was nothing they could do that, despite the loans not even technically being in my name, which I have major issues with and am extremely confused by. Now, I am stuck with a terrible credit score and wondering what happened with this whole situation. First, I would like to know whether or not those loans are truly mine given that my legal name is not the name attached to those loans. This is causing me to question whether or not there was some sort of foul play here because I always use my legal name on official documents and legal matters. Second, I am wondering if Nelnet can contact the credit companies to take all these missed payments off my record due to their poor communication and if I am obligated to pay those loans, then I will make the payments.', 'Originally, I took out Financial Aid between XXXX - XXXX. I was the first in my family to attend college at XXXX. Therefore, I was not aware and was never told by my financial aid officer that I would have to repay these.

XXXX XXXX XXXX took control of the loan for a few years. Then, it went to NelNet without my knowledge or consent. I have received emails to make payments or update my information. When I go online, it constantly locks me out saying my information is incorrect. The last time I did go on ( XXXX ) it said that I do not have to make a payment until XX/XX/XXXX with no reason why. However, my balance and debt continues to grow in my credit report. Over the past 10 years, despite payments, my balance has increased 18 %. My credit report says the highest balance is {$58000.00}. However, as of XX/XX/XXXX, it says the balance is {$69000.00}. That is literally a difference of {$10000.00}. On NelNet it says my outstanding principle is {$62000.00} with interest of {$6600.00}. None of these numbers match or add up. I have never received a breakdown as to why or received information on my loan or the interest of the loan. And yet, my credit is suffering because of this. It seems that I am not required to pay and yet the interest ( which I have no idea what that is ) is continuing to grow.

Until such time, I request a hold on any collections, wage garnishment, or reporting to credit bureaus. \\nFurthermore, in light of recent legal and administrative developments, including proposed executive actions to restructure the U.S. Department of Education and shift student loan servicing and oversight to other federal agencies such as the Small Business Administration, I seek immediate clarification of how such structural changes may impact the legitimacy and continuity of any outstanding obligations. \\nLegal Basis for Dispute Higher Education Act of 1965 ( 20 U.S.C. 1087e ) : \\\\nUnder this act, federal student loans must comply with very specific disclosure, servicing, and borrower protection requirements. I request copies of all signed master promissory notes ( MPNs ), disbursement records, and evidence of compliance with disclosure requirements. \\nTruth in Lending Act ( 15 U.S.C. 1601 et seq. ) : \\\\nAny entity involved in extending credit or collecting payments must provide clear, timely, and transparent information about terms, interest rates, and repayment options. I dispute whether such disclosures were provided or understood at the time of origination. \\nFair Credit Reporting Act ( 15 U.S.C. 1681 ) : \\\\nIf this loan is being reported to credit bureaus, you are required to ensure that all information is accurate, verifiable, and complete. Inaccurate reporting constitutes a violation of my rights and may result in legal penalties. \\nAdministrative Procedure Act ( 5 U.S.C. 551559 ) : \\\\nAny major change in agency structure, authority, or regulation ( such as dismantling the Department of Education or transferring loan oversight ) must be governed by due process and public rulemaking. Until such clarity is established, enforcement of loan obligations may be legally premature. \\nBorrower Defense to Repayment ( 34 CFR 685.206 ) : \\\\nIf the school or lender engaged in deceptive or unlawful practices, I reserve the right to pursue a full discharge under this program. I request a review of whether my educational institution is under investigation or has been involved in any such misconduct. \\nRequest for Action Provide full validation and accounting of the loan ( s ), including : Original loan agreements and disbursement records Payment history Interest and fee breakdown Place the loan in forbearance or administrative hold during the investigation Cease any collection or wage garnishment efforts Refrain from reporting negative information to credit bureaus Clarify any upcoming changes in loan servicing authority related to agency restructuring If this matter is not resolved within 30 days, I reserve the right to escalate my concerns to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ), State Attorney General, and/or pursue remedies through legal channels. \\nThank you for your prompt attention to this matter.

            "\n",
            "1. **Disrupted Recertification Process:** Conflicting information or failure to communicate effectively about servicer transitions can cause delays or errors in processing IDR recertification applications.

This miscalculation can jeopardize progress toward forgiveness and cause financial hardship.\n",

            "4. **Errors in Recertification Data and Credit Reporting:** As seen in complaints about Nelnet reporting late payments or misreporting account status, poor communication and mismanagement can lead to inaccuracies in credit reports. These inaccuracies can negatively impact credit scores and complicate efforts to qualify for forgiveness or income-based repayment plans.\n",
            "\n",

After that, they returned with the exact same incorrect payment amount. \\n\\nWhen I pressed for clarification, Aidvantage responded that my IDR application has not been processed yet, even though they had already issued a bill and claimed it was based on a recalculation. This is a clear contradiction. You can not bill a borrower for an IDR plan amount before processing the application. \\n\\nAidvantage has not requested any additional documentation from me.

That interest was capitalized and added to the principal during consolidation, raising my balance significantly. I was never clearly informed that this would occur.\\n\\nDuring the lengthy processing period of my consolidation application, an additional {$5500.00} in interest accrued by the time I was placed in the SAVE program. I did not receive proper disclosure that interest would accumulate during this time. I called several times, and multiple representatives apologized for the misinformation. This is in the call logs. \\n\\nIn XX/XX/year>, I submitted my IDR recertification. Shortly after, I received a letter from Nelnet stating that my loans would be placed in forbearance and would not accrue interest during this time. Despite this assurance, my interest has now ballooned to over {$9000.00}. This contradicts Nelnets written communication and represents a misrepresentation of loan servicing terms.\\n\\nI have attempted to resolve this directly with Nelnet, but I continue to receive inconsistent responses, no clear accountability, and no correction of the errors.', 'I am filing a complaint regarding improper handling of my federal student loans by Nelnet, particularly related to lack of required notification and premature delinquency reporting. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, Nelnet sent me a letter through their portal stating that my federal loans with 0 % interest were paused as of XX/XX/XXXX, through when the payment pause would end, under COVID-19 relief measures and explicitly said : We will notify you in advance of when these relief measures will end. However, I never received any communication from Nelnet notifying me that repayment was restarting, or when my first bill would be due. \\n\\nThe first indication I received that my loans had entered repayment came in a letter from their portal dated XX/XX/XXXX, stating I was already 15 days past due. I received another notice from their portal on XX/XX/XXXX with the same message, stating that I was again 15 days past due. Then, on XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter from their portal saying I was 45 days past due. Again, none of these letters came with prior billing statements or warnings about due dates.

This was deeply concerning, especially since XXXX is the designated servicer for PSLF, and my loans have not yet been transferred from EdFinancial. \\n\\nViolations and Legal Basis : Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), data furnishers like EdFinancial must report accurate and timely information. Reporting me delinquent while in active repayment plan review appears to violate this principle. They are waiting over a week, despite being current as of today. \\n\\nUnder the Higher Education Act ( HEA ), borrowers in the process of applying for an income-driven plan should not be penalized with negative credit marks or be given misleading servicing advice that jeopardizes PSLF eligibility.\", 'I received notice that my XXXX score dropped from XXXX to XXXX.

However, I believe the resulting credit damage is severely disproportionate, and the transition was poorly communicated, creating confusion about my loan status and available options. \\n\\nFirst, Nelnet has a documented history of consumer complaints related to poor communication, lack of transparency during delinquency, and unclear servicing practices, especially during periods of account transition. In my case, I was not informed clearly or promptly that my loans were being transferred, nor was I provided consistent information about whether payments were still due or whether forbearance or deferment options were available. \\n\\nAfter the transfer to XXXX, the accounts were placed into Administrative Forbearance, and no payments are currently required. Despite this, my credit reports still reflect dozens of 90-day late payment entries reported by Nelnet, one for each individual loan, even though the loans are no longer delinquent and have not entered default. \\n\\nI believe this reporting violates the principles of fair and accurate credit reporting, and does not reflect the current status of the account. While the technical reporting may be accurate from Nelnets perspective, the outcome for me as a borrower is deeply harmful and inconsistent with the spirit of federal student loan policy, especially when my accounts are now current and in government-sanctioned forbearance. \\n\\nI have attached a screenshot from my loan servicer portal showing the Administrative Forbearance status and the fact that no payment is due. \\n\\nThank you for your time and assistance.', 'Thank you for reviewing my concerns.

Despite this, Aidvantage incorrectly relied on a XX/XX/XXXX graduation date, as reported in an earlier data transfer, and initiated repayment with a due date of XXXX XXXXwithout verifying the updated NSLDS information. This misalignment led to the wrongful early start of my repayment period. \\n\\nI proactively worked with the University of Georgia to correct the record. On XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX, Senior Assistant Registrar, confirmed that UGA  manually updated the graduation date in the NSLDS Clearinghouse to reflect my summer XXXX graduation term. This means Aidvantage has access to the correct data and still failed to adjust my grace period or repayment terms accordingly. \\n\\nAidvantages statement that \" there is no negative reporting \\'\\' is misleading. While they may not have marked payments as formally delinquent, the incorrect repayment start date has affected the accounts age, status, and monthly payment history, which are critical components of credit scoring models used by mortgage underwriters, financial institutions, etc. The impact is not limited to delinquencyaccuracy matters. \\n\\nDespite calls and emails, including my direct outreach to my assigned representative, XXXX, I have not received confirmation that : Aidvantage received and processed the corrected NSLDS data ; My grace period has been properly reinstated ; My repayment start date has been realigned with the correct graduation date ; My credit file has been updated to reflect these changes. \\n\\nUnder the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), furnishers of credit information have a legal obligation to report accurate and complete information.

            "Response: The difficulty in making payments after the end of COVID-19 forbearance stems from multiple systemic issues with loan servicers and the handling of transitioning out of the forbearance period. Based on the complaints provided, several factors contribute to this frustration:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. Lack of Clear Communication: Many borrowers report not receiving timely notifications about changes in their loan status, such as the end date of forbearance, transfer of loans between servicers, or adjustments to auto-pay arrangements. This leaves borrowers uncertain about who to pay and when, increasing confusion and risk of missed or late payments.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. Servicer Changes and Transfers: Loan transfers often happen without proper or timely notices. Borrowers were sometimes not informed of the new servicer or the new payment terms, leading to uncertainty about payment processing and account status.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. Unexpected Payment Increases: Some borrowers experienced their payments almost doubling after forbearance ended, often without prior notice or explanation. Changes in amortization or interest capitalization following transfers or re-amortization can cause such increases, but the lack of communication makes it difficult for borrowers to understand these changes.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. Inconsistent and Unclear Notices: Complaints highlight difficulties in obtaining written explanations for changes, including in auto-pay amounts, loan status, or interest charges. When notifications are absent or unclear, borrowers are left trying to decipher complicated information from multiple sources.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. Systemic Failures and Bad Recordkeeping: Several complaints point to systemic issues like data mismanagement, failure to retain proper records, and errors in loan balances or reporting. This can cause further confusion, inaccuracies on credit reports, and difficulty verifying balances or payments.\n",
            "\n",
            "6. Lack of Transparency and Accountability: Borrowers report feeling overwhelmed by inconsistent or absent communication, especially during the transition phases out of pandemic relief programs, which makes managing payments unfair and stressful.\n",
            "\n",
            "7. Fairness Concerns: Many borrowers feel that such practices are unfair, especially when they are attempting to meet their obligations during a difficult period. The sudden appearance of large payment increases, incorrect reporting, or transfer errors can cause financial hardship and erode trust in the system.\n",
            "\n",
            "In summary, the challenges are largely due to inadequate communication, mismanagement during transition periods, and systemic issues within loan servicing entities. These practices make it very difficult for borrowers to navigate their repayment obligations fairly and transparently, and many feel they are unfairly penalized without proper notice or explanation.\n",

Rather than informing me of my eligibility for income-driven repayment ( IDR ) plans or the federal loan rehabilitation program ( per servicer obligations under Title IV of the Higher Education Act ), I was steered into a series of long-term forbearances. Customer service representatives pressed that I qualified for \" XXXX dollar payments \\'\\' and that there were no consequences, and no other options were provided to me. \\n\\nWhen the forbearance expired around XXXX, I was contacted and told that unless I could afford an exorbitant paymentunaffordable at the timemy only option was consolidation. I was NOT told about IDR or rehabilitation, both of which I later discovered would have preserved my balance, avoided interest capitalization, and maintained progress toward loan forgiveness. \\n\\nAs a result of this coercive consolidation by XXXX, my balance ballooned from ~ {$48000.00} to over {$85000.00}. It capitalized interest and reset my forgiveness clock. Since then, I have made over 151 qualifying IDR payments. \\n\\nCritically, the data shows that I was placed in repeated forbearances at XXXX \\'s recommendation during my financial hardship. I was not informed that these forbearances would expire or that they could lead to default. When my forbearance period expired, I was contacted by XXXX and told that my only option was to either consolidate or make unaffordable payments in excess of {$500.00} per month. This created a false urgency and removed any meaningful choice-no income-driven repayment ( IDR ) or rehabilitation plans were offered. This tactic aligns with the forbearance steering practices that were cited in the CFPB \\'s 2022 enforcement actions against student loan servicers. It was at that point, under financial duress and without being informed of legal alternatives, that I was coerced into consolidating, causing irreversible financial harm. \\nThis case represents a textbook instance of forbearance steering, as defined by the CFPB \\'s 2022 enforcement actions against XXXX and supported by federal regulation ( 34 CFR 682.211 ( f ), 685.205 ( b ) ). During the period from XXXX  to XXXX, XXXX failed to inform me of available income-driven repayment ( IDR ) plans or the federally mandated 9-month rehabilitation program, both of which were legal options under Title IV of the Higher Education Act. Instead, I was repeatedly placed into forbearance until its expiration, at which point I was pressured into consolidating under the threat of unaffordable monthly payments exceeding {$500.00}. This practice violated servicer obligations and has since been identified by the Department of Education and the CFPB as a systemic failure. My experience directly aligns with the borrower harms being remedied under the IDR Account Adjustment initiative ( XXXX ), which was implemented to address improper servicing, including coerced consolidations and loss of forgiveness progress. \\nThrough modeling and consultation with financial experts, I now understand that if I had entered a rehabilitation plan instead of consolidating, my balance today could be nearly half of what it is now. \\nRehabilitation would have preserved my original loans, minimized interest capitalization, and maintained forgiveness eligibility. I have attached a visual comparison of my current repayment path versus the alternative I was never informed of.\\n\\nAdditionally, I made a good-faith attempt to obtain documentation regarding my original disbursements, at the suggestion of my current servicer, Aidvantage. I was advised that with those documents, a balance review could potentially occur. I contacted the XXXX  XXXX XXXX  Financial Aid Office, but was informed that records were no longer available due to the time elapsed since graduation.

XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to file a formal complaint regarding my student loans, as I am currently coming out of forbearance and have noticed some troubling discrepancies with my loan balances and interest rates. \\n\\nOver the years, my loans have been sold several times, which I understand may contribute to some of the confusion surrounding my account. However, I am concerned about the substantial increases in interest rates that I have seen on some of my loans. When I originally took out the loans, the interest rates were set at a standard percentage. However, it appears that these rates have significantly increased, which I believe is unfair and potentially in violation of the original terms of my loan agreements. \\n\\nGiven the financial strain I have faced in trying to keep up with payments, especially during and after forbearance, it is disheartening to see the interest rates skyrocketing and my balances growing despite my efforts to make payments. I find this situation to be unfair, and I believe that my loans should be handled in accordance with the terms originally agreed upon, without unjustified increases in interest. \\n\\nI respectfully request that the CFPB investigate my loans and help ensure that my balances and interest rates are accurate. I am also seeking guidance on what steps I can take to resolve this matter with my loan servicer.', \"When my federal student loans were transferred to Nelnet, Servicer to Federal Student Aid, in XX/XX/XXXX, I enrolled in AutoPay with a scheduled monthly payment of {$190.00}. Since that time, my AutoPay was unexpectedly placed into forbearance without my initiation or consent around XX/XX/XXXX. Most recently, in XX/XX/XXXX, my AutoPay amount was changed to {$150.00}, again, without any prior notification or approval from me. \\nWhen I contacted Nelnet 's customer service, I was not given a clear explanation for these changes. I requested a written explanation for the adjustment, but was informed that this was not something they could provide. \\nI am deeply concerned by these unauthorized modifications. If I had not been closely monitoring my account, I might not have noticed these changes. Reducing my AutoPay amount without consent could potentially extend the term of my loan and increase the total interest I pay over time, which feels misleading and unfair.\\n\\nI would appreciate a formal, written explanation of why these changes occurred and what steps are being taken at the Bureau level to monitor Nelnet to ensure this does not happen again without my consent.\", \"I was never notified that my student loans were transferred from one borrower to another and then split one loan to 8 each with its own interest rate.

            "\n",
            "1. **Frequent Servicer Transfers and Poor Communication:** Many loans are sold or transferred between servicers without adequate notice to borrowers. The complaints highlight that borrowers often do not receive timely or official notification about these changes, leading to confusion about who currently manages their loans.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Contradictory Information and Billing Practices:** As servicers change, different companies may provide conflicting details about loan status, repayment terms, and payment processing. For example, Aidvantage and Nelnet have provided inconsistent information about balances, interest accrual, and billing, making it hard to keep track.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Technical and Administrative Errors:** Complaints indicate ongoing errors like misapplied payments, incorrect loan balances, unrecognized account changes, and failure to update account statuses (e.g., in-school deferment vs. repayment). These errors can cause misbillings and increase stress.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Limited or Ineffective Customer Support:** Many borrowers report long hold times, disconnections, and unresponsive customer service. This makes resolving issues difficult and often leads to continued mistakes or lack of clarity.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Lack of Clear Notifications:** Many borrowers are unaware of changes in their loan servicing, account status, or billing updates because servicers do not provide proactive communication, leaving borrowers to discover problems only when negative impacts (like credit score drops or unexpected bills) occur.\n",
            "\n",
            "**How to avoid problems:**\n",
            "- **Keep Personal Records:** Save all correspondence, payment confirmations, and account statements.\n",
            "- **Regularly Monitor Your Accounts:** Log into your servicer’s portal frequently to verify balances, interest, and status.\n",
            "- **Confirm Servicer Contact Info:** Use official websites (like StudentAid.gov) to verify current servicers and their contact information.\n",
            "- **Request Written Confirmations:** When changes occur or issues arise, ask for written documentation for your records.\n",
            "- **Utilize the Federal Student Aid Dashboard:** This centralized platform consolidates loan info from all servicers and can help track your loan status.\n",

            "Response: It sounds like you're experiencing a complex situation where your student loan payments are difficult to manage due to frequent servicer changes, contradictory billing practices, and communication issues. Here's how these problems are connected and what you can generally expect while this mess is being sorted out:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Frequent Servicer Changes and Transfers:** When your loans move between different servicers (like Nelnet, Aidvantage, MOHELA, etc.), inconsistencies can occur in account information, payment processing, and communication. This often leads to delays, incorrect balances, or payments being reversed without clear explanations.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Contradictory Billing and Payment Confusion:** Receiving conflicting information—from being told by Nelnet that your issuer is someone else to Aidvantage providing nonsensical payment amounts—indicates poor communication and a lack of consolidated, clear information. Such situations can cause concern about whether payments are being applied correctly, whether interest is accruing improperly, and how your income-driven repayment (IDR) recertifications are being handled.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Impact of Poor Communication and Billing Practices:** When there are errors like misapplied payments, incorrect balances, or lack of notifications about servicer changes, it can lead to increased interest, missed payments, and negative reporting on your credit, which seem to be happening in your case.\n",
            "\n",
            "**How these issues connect:**\n",
            "- Frequent servicer changes and poor communication cause confusion about account status, balances, and payments.\n",
            "- This confusion results in payments being misapplied, reversed, or not reflected properly on your account.\n",
            "- Contradictory information and lack of transparency exacerbate concerns about interest accrual, payment accuracy, and overall loan management, especially when recertifications are submitted on time but not reflected properly.\n",
            "\n",
            "**What to expect while this mess is being sorted:**\n",
            "- Continued administrative delays: It may take time for servicers or the Department of Education to resolve account discrepancies, update balances, and correct credit reporting.\n",
            "- Ongoing communication issues: Expect some frustration with inconsistent or unclear responses from servicers.\n",
            "- Potential for temporary negative credit reporting: Incorrect late payments and balance reports may persist until your account issues are fully corrected.\n",
            "- Assistance and clarification: Keep detailed records of all communications, payments, and correspondences. Consider filing formal complaints with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) or your state attorney general if issues persist.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Recommendations:**\n",
            "- Persistently follow up with your servicer(s), requesting written explanations for changes and corrections.\n",
            "- Document all interactions, payments, and issues.\n",

On XX/XX/year>, I noticed that my loan balance was incorrectly reported as {$3700.00} instead of {$3500.00} due to interest charges, despite my payments being up to date and my qualifications as a student on a subsidized loan. Additionally, the payment of {$200.00} made on XX/XX/scrub>XXXX XXXX XXXX was misapplied with {$82.00} going to interest instead of the full amount going to principal. \\n\\nI contacted customer service on XX/XX/scrub>XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and spoke with XXXX XXXX XXXX from XXXX customer service assured me that they had received my in-school deferment request from XXXX XXXX with an effective date of XX/XX/year>. She also confirmed that interest on this loan does not accrue while I am in school, so the {$200.00} payment I sent on XX/XX/XXXX would be redistributed to the principal only. \\nToday, my loan is continuing to accrue interest and is up to {$5400.00}. My in-school deferment was wrongfully denied, despite meeting the eligibility requirements. \\n\\nXXXX. Supporting Documents Available Upon Request : Loan Number and Borrower Information Payment records Loan statements Email/chat transcripts with servicer Other : Screenshot of current balance and continued interest', 'Originally, I took out Financial Aid between XXXX - XXXX. I was the first in my family to attend college at XXXX. Therefore, I was not aware and was never told by my financial aid officer that I would have to repay these. I did not realize that I had to pay everything back until XXXX. At that time, I did get on a payment plan and I remember it was around {$40000.00}. XXXX XXXX XXXX took control of the loan for a few years. Then, it went to NelNet without my knowledge or consent. I have received emails to make payments or update my information. When I go online, it constantly locks me out saying my information is incorrect. The last time I did go on ( XXXX ) it said that I do not have to make a payment until XX/XX/XXXX with no reason why. However, my balance and debt continues to grow in my credit report. Over the past 10 years, despite payments, my balance has increased 18 %. My credit report says the highest balance is {$58000.00}. However, as of XX/XX/XXXX, it says the balance is {$69000.00}. That is literally a difference of {$10000.00}. On NelNet it says my outstanding principle is {$62000.00} with interest of {$6600.00}. None of these numbers match or add up. I have never received a breakdown as to why or received information on my loan or the interest of the loan. And yet, my credit is suffering because of this. It seems that I am not required to pay and yet the interest ( which I have no idea what that is ) is continuing to grow. I am filing a complaint based on incorrect information, lack of communication, lack of documentation, unethical and unapproved transfers of my loans, and the possible violations of my rights under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ( FERPA ) and the improper handling of student loan data by the Department of Education ( DOE ).', \"When my federal student loans were transferred to Nelnet, Servicer to Federal Student Aid, in XX/XX/XXXX, I enrolled in AutoPay with a scheduled monthly payment of {$190.00}. Since that time, my AutoPay was unexpectedly placed into forbearance without my initiation or consent around XX/XX/XXXX. Most recently, in XX/XX/XXXX, my AutoPay amount was changed to {$150.00}, again, without any prior notification or approval from me. \\nWhen I contacted Nelnet 's customer service, I was not given a clear explanation for these changes. I requested a written explanation for the adjustment, but was informed that this was not something they could provide. \\nI am deeply concerned by these unauthorized modifications. If I had not been closely monitoring my account, I might not have noticed these changes. Reducing my AutoPay amount without consent could potentially extend the term of my loan and increase the total interest I pay over time, which feels misleading and unfair.\\n\\nI would appreciate a formal, written explanation of why these changes occurred and what steps are being taken at the Bureau level to monitor Nelnet to ensure this does not happen again without my consent.\", \"Since XX/XX/XXXX, I have been attempting to log into my Nelnet account to pay my loan : I was unable to log in, noting that my password was incorrect. I reset my password, it didn't work. Made multiple attempts, and then reached out to Nelnet directly. Despite back and forth correspondence, including requesting my personal details in order to provide me my account number directly, no resolution was achieved. My account information was never given ( see attached item # 1 ). \\n\\nSeeing the 90 day late payment notice on my credit report, I called Nelnet today, XX/XX/XXXX, and was informed I, inexplicably, have a new username ( see item # 2 for previous studentaid.gov username, and new Nelnet username. ) It is unclear to me why this was not mentioned in the multiple attempts at resolving this issue, or why the nelnet login portal did not tell me the username was 'incorrect ' even though it successfully sent the password reset links to my email address. \\n\\nAfter this, my outstanding balance was paid immediately and in full ( item # 3 ). I asked to speak to a supervisor, who refused to acknowledge any of this. I attempted to share with him the litany of online complaints ( see item # 4 ) about this EXACT issue.\", \"I received notice from the U.S. Department of Education in XX/XX/year> confirming the full discharge of my student loans related to XXXXXXXX XXXX The Department stated that my loan balances would be corrected, and my credit reports updated within 45 days of the final discharge letter dated XX/XX/year>. \\n\\nDespite multiple calls to my servicer ( Nelnet ) and formal complaints, my loans still appear on my credit report with incorrect balances, and interest continues to accrue on unrelated balances while in deferment. Nelnet representatives have stated it could take up to three years to resolve this, which directly conflicts with the Department 's 45-day correction timeline. \\n\\nI have requested the accurate balance for loans unrelated to XXXX so I can continue repayment, but Nelnet has been unable to provide this information. I have also requested a transfer of the remaining balance, and they have stated they can not identify the amount until the discharge is finalized. \\n\\nI have contacted Nelnet multiple times, filed a complaint with Federal Student Aid, and yet I am still being told it could take three years to complete despite Nelnet and the Department already acknowledging the discharge amount of {$32000.00}.\\n\\nI am requesting assistance to ensure my account is corrected immediately and that I am able to resume payments on any remaining valid loan balance without further delay.\", 'I have already complained about my student loan servicer Aidvantage in XXXX.

I XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXX/XX/XXXX. From there, I consolidated what I believed were my federal and private loans. Since the day I graduated, I have never missed a single payment on repaying my loans. XXXX weeks ago, I received an email from XXXX XXXX stating that my XXXX XXXX dropped. It is now in the XXXX range when it has been between XXXX my entire life. I checked why it dropped and it was because Nelnet reported missed student aid payments to my credit since XX/XX/XXXX. Meanwhile, I have never heard of Nelnet. I had to create an account with them to view what the issue was. From there, I saw there were were loans that were apparently not refinanced into my original account from XXXX years ago, which was very odd and shocking. I had no idea those loans even existed, nor was I ever told my loans were sold from Great Lakes to Nelnet. The email they somehow had on file was not an email address I use, so I never saw any of their email correspondences. They rarely called and if they did, it was a pre-recorded voicemail, not an actual person, whereupon they would ask for my social security number right away. The address they had on file was also not my address, so I never received any mail. My father cosigned on my loans and he was never contacted in any capacity from them. They also do not have my legal name on file. My legal name is XXXX XXXX XXXX. They somehow only had \" XXXX XXXX \\'\\' in their system, despite me never having an account to begin with, which is alarming. I am extremely concerned about my credit score being as low as it is and when I spoke to someone on the phone to explain the situation and emphasized their lack of communication, they said there was nothing they could do that, despite the loans not even technically being in my name, which I have major issues with and am extremely confused by. Now, I am stuck with a terrible credit score and wondering what happened with this whole situation. First, I would like to know whether or not those loans are truly mine given that my legal name is not the name attached to those loans. This is causing me to question whether or not there was some sort of foul play here because I always use my legal name on official documents and legal matters. Second, I am wondering if Nelnet can contact the credit companies to take all these missed payments off my record due to their poor communication and if I am obligated to pay those loans, then I will make the payments.', 'According to Studentaid.gov, Im to get an email and a letter of notice that my servicer is being changed. studentaid.gov says that my issuer is nelnet.

My loans have since been transferred to a new servicer, XXXX and the accounts are currently in Administrative Forbearance, with no payments due until XX/XX/XXXX and all accounts paid up and in good standing. \\n\\nDuring my time with Nelnet, I did fall behind on payments in XX/XX/XXXX. However, I believe the resulting credit damage is severely disproportionate, and the transition was poorly communicated, creating confusion about my loan status and available options. \\n\\nFirst, Nelnet has a documented history of consumer complaints related to poor communication, lack of transparency during delinquency, and unclear servicing practices, especially during periods of account transition. In my case, I was not informed clearly or promptly that my loans were being transferred, nor was I provided consistent information about whether payments were still due or whether forbearance or deferment options were available. \\n\\nAfter the transfer to XXXX, the accounts were placed into Administrative Forbearance, and no payments are currently required. Despite this, my credit reports still reflect dozens of 90-day late payment entries reported by Nelnet, one for each individual loan, even though the loans are no longer delinquent and have not entered default. \\n\\nI believe this reporting violates the principles of fair and accurate credit reporting, and does not reflect the current status of the account. While the technical reporting may be accurate from Nelnets perspective, the outcome for me as a borrower is deeply harmful and inconsistent with the spirit of federal student loan policy, especially when my accounts are now current and in government-sanctioned forbearance. \\n\\nI have attached a screenshot from my loan servicer portal showing the Administrative Forbearance status and the fact that no payment is due. \\n\\nThank you for your time and assistance.', 'My student loan is serviced by XXXX XXXX XXXX It is a Consolidation Loan, standard repayment plan, XXXX XXXX, and the lender name XXXX.

When making payments, it will only let you apply additional funds in a manner of the servicer 's choosing, most of which gets applied to interest. This manner of repayment is predatory and prohibits timely manner of loan repayment, ensuring that the loan servicer drains as much money as possible during the repayment process. Public student loan repayment programs are designed to keep the student in debt as long as possible.\", 'Unfortunately, I have found that I was taken advantage of by a textbook example of forbearance steering, as defined by the CFPBs 2022 enforcement actions against XXXX and supported by federal regulation ( 34 CFR 682.211 ( f ), 685.205 ( b ) ). \\n\\nBetween XXXX and XXXX, I contacted XXXX repeatedly due to financial hardship. Rather than informing me of my eligibility for income-driven repayment ( IDR ) plans or the federal loan rehabilitation program ( per servicer obligations under Title IV of the Higher Education Act ), I was steered into a series of long-term forbearances. Customer service representatives pressed that I qualified for \" XXXX dollar payments \\'\\' and that there were no consequences, and no other options were provided to me. \\n\\nWhen the forbearance expired around XXXX, I was contacted and told that unless I could afford an exorbitant paymentunaffordable at the timemy only option was consolidation. I was NOT told about IDR or rehabilitation, both of which I later discovered would have preserved my balance, avoided interest capitalization, and maintained progress toward loan forgiveness. \\n\\nAs a result of this coercive consolidation by XXXX, my balance ballooned from ~ {$48000.00} to over {$85000.00}. It capitalized interest and reset my forgiveness clock. Since then, I have made over 151 qualifying IDR payments. \\n\\nCritically, the data shows that I was placed in repeated forbearances at XXXX \\'s recommendation during my financial hardship. I was not informed that these forbearances would expire or that they could lead to default. When my forbearance period expired, I was contacted by XXXX and told that my only option was to either consolidate or make unaffordable payments in excess of {$500.00} per month. This created a false urgency and removed any meaningful choice-no income-driven repayment ( IDR ) or rehabilitation plans were offered. This tactic aligns with the forbearance steering practices that were cited in the CFPB \\'s 2022 enforcement actions against student loan servicers. It was at that point, under financial duress and without being informed of legal alternatives, that I was coerced into consolidating, causing irreversible financial harm. \\nThis case represents a textbook instance of forbearance steering, as defined by the CFPB \\'s 2022 enforcement actions against XXXX and supported by federal regulation ( 34 CFR 682.211 ( f ), 685.205 ( b ) ). During the period from XXXX  to XXXX, XXXX failed to inform me of available income-driven repayment ( IDR ) plans or the federally mandated 9-month rehabilitation program, both of which were legal options under Title IV of the Higher Education Act. Instead, I was repeatedly placed into forbearance until its expiration, at which point I was pressured into consolidating under the threat of unaffordable monthly payments exceeding {$500.00}. This practice violated servicer obligations and has since been identified by the Department of Education and the CFPB as a systemic failure. My experience directly aligns with the borrower harms being remedied under the IDR Account Adjustment initiative ( XXXX ), which was implemented to address improper servicing, including coerced consolidations and loss of forgiveness progress. \\nThrough modeling and consultation with financial experts, I now understand that if I had entered a rehabilitation plan instead of consolidating, my balance today could be nearly half of what it is now. \\nRehabilitation would have preserved my original loans, minimized interest capitalization, and maintained forgiveness eligibility. I have attached a visual comparison of my current repayment path versus the alternative I was never informed of.\\n\\nAdditionally, I made a good-faith attempt to obtain documentation regarding my original disbursements, at the suggestion of my current servicer, Aidvantage. I was advised that with those documents, a balance review could potentially occur. I contacted the XXXX  XXXX XXXX  Financial Aid Office, but was informed that records were no longer available due to the time elapsed since graduation. Likewise, my prior servicer, XXXX, no longer retains access to these historical records. \\nThis systemic failure to retain critical borrower documentation, compounded by coercive servicing practices, has caused enduring financial harm. I believe this case exemplifies the very forbearance and consolidation steering practices cited in prior CFPB and state attorney general actions against XXXX.', 'My student loan is serviced by XXXX XXXX XXXX It is a Consolidation Loan, standard repayment plan, XXXX XXXX, and the lender name XXXX. In XX/XX/XXXX I received a monthly bill for {$240.00} instead of the {$100.00} I was previously paying each month. I called the company for an explanation. Prior to seeing this bill, I received no advance notice of this change and no explanation for the increase. I was told that the date of the original terms had passed and now I needed to adjust to a new payment amount, over double the previous amount. The payment was due immediately. \\n\\nI just received an email today, XX/XX/XXXX, stating that my monthly payment is {$500.00}. Again I received no warning and no explanation for this substantial increase. The payment is due, in full, tomorrow. \\n\\nThis can not be a fair business practice and if it happening to me, I can be sure that I am not the only one. If there are to be substantial increases in payments, there needs to be notifications and sufficient explanations with clear guidance for the customer.', \"The federal student loan COVID-19 forbearance program ended in XX/XX/XXXX.

            "Response: The confusion surrounding student loan servicing after the federal student loan forbearance program ended stems from several factors highlighted in the complaints:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Inconsistent and Inaccurate Communication:** Many borrowers report not receiving proper notifications about changes in their loan status, such as the end of forbearance, loan transfers, or changes in repayment plans. For example, borrowers mentioned not being notified when their loans were transferred to new servicers or when forbearances concluded, leading to uncertainty.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Loan Transfers and Multiple Servicers:** Over the years, loans have been sold or transferred between various servicers, often without clear or timely communication. This causes confusion about who manages the loan and how to access accurate information.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Discrepancies in Loan Information:** Complaints reveal issues such as unrecognized increases in loan balances during periods of supposed interest-free forbearance, incorrect reporting of late payments, and missing or conflicting details about repayment status and interest accrual.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Technical and Administrative Errors:** Many borrowers experienced errors like improper billing, incorrect interest calculations, or accounts showing activity despite ongoing forbearance. Some reported their loans accruing interest or balances increasing when they were told they should have been in a no-interest period.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Lack of Transparency and Delayed Customer Service:** Several complaints mention long wait times, disconnections, and unresponsive customer service, making it difficult to get clear explanations or corrections.\n",
            "\n",
            "6. **Systemic Issues from Loan Servicer Practices:** Practices like \"forbearance steering,\" where borrowers are repeatedly placed into forbearance rather than informed about available income-driven repayment options, have led to unintended consequences like ballooning balances and loss of forgiveness opportunities.\n",
            "\n",
            "In summary, the combination of poor communication, administrative errors, complex loan transfer histories, and systemic servicing practices have generated widespread confusion and frustration among borrowers after the end of the federal forbearance program.\n",

            "Response: The increase in your federal student loan payments after the end of the COVID-19 forbearance program can be due to several factors:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Re-amortization of your loans:** During the forbearance period, interest usually did not accrue or was handled differently, and payments may have been temporarily paused or reduced. Once the forbearance ended, loans needed to be re-amortized, meaning the monthly payments were recalculated based on the current balance, interest rate, and remaining term. If the original repayment plan was extended or if interest accrued during forbearance, your new payments could be substantially higher.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Interest Accumulation During Forbearance:** Some accounts continued to accrue interest even during the period of forbearance, increasing your total balance. When payments resume, you might be paying off this accumulated interest in addition to the principal, leading to higher monthly payments.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Loan Servicer Actions:** According to complaints, there can be delays or issues in re-amortizing loans after forbearance ends, which may cause automatic increases in payments or disparities in how payments are applied.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Potential Changes in Loan Terms or Fees:** In some cases, fees or interest charges that were deferred or handled differently during forbearance can be added or calculated, further increasing the payment amount.\n",
            "\n",
            "If your payments nearly doubled, it’s likely due to re-amortization based on the current balance and interest, especially if interest banked during forbearance was added to your principal. It's advisable to check with your loan servicer (e.g., Nelnet) for an explanation specific to your account and to ensure that your repayment plan aligns with your financial situation. You might also consider requesting an review or a different repayment plan if the new payments are challenging to meet.\n",

            "Response: Based on the complaints provided, Aidvantage assigned some borrowers an incorrect monthly payment amount on their Income-Driven Repayment (IDR) plans despite their income qualifying them for a lower payment. The main reasons for this seem to include:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Application Processing Delays:** Although borrowers submitted recertification documents on time and their applications were marked as approved or in processing, Aidvantage sometimes delayed applying the correct calculation. In some cases, the application was marked as \"not processed yet,\" yet bills were issued based on recalculations, which is contradictory.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Lack of Communication and Clarification:** Aidvantage often did not request additional documentation or communicate clearly about the processing status. This led to situations where borrowers continued to be billed at incorrect amounts despite their applications being approved.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Administrative Errors and Delays:** There are instances where the system or staff did not update the payment amount promptly after recertification approval, resulting in billing errors. Some borrowers had to request forbearances or experienced inflated payments, leading to financial hardship.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Inconsistent Handling of Recertification:** Even after applications were approved, the correct recalculated payments were not consistently applied, possibly due to internal processing issues or miscommunication.\n",
            "\n",
            "As for the actions Aidvantage has taken in response to inquiries:\n",
            "\n",
            "- They placed some borrowers in temporary forbearance (usually for two months).\n",
            "- In most cases, their official response was to inform borrowers that their application had not been processed, despite billing discrepancies, or that the application was still in processing.\n",
            "- The company responded with explanations that did not resolve the payment inaccuracies; their responses were often marked as \"closed with explanation.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "In summary, the incorrect payment assignments appear primarily due to processing and communication delays or errors on Aidvantage's part. They have responded by placing borrowers in forbearance and providing explanations, but in many cases, the correct payment amounts have not yet been applied or clarified.\n",

            "Response: It is difficult to make payments when your servicer keeps changing and your monthly payment nearly doubles after forbearance ends because of several factors. During the end of the COVID-19 forbearance, loans were supposed to be re-amortized to reflect the original repayment terms, but in many cases, this re-amortization was delayed or not executed promptly. When it finally occurred, the new payment amounts can significantly increase, sometimes nearly doubling previous payments, as seen in your situation. Additionally, if your loans are transferred between servicers, such as Nelnet or Aidvantage, there might be issues like unexpected placement into forbearance, unauthorized changes to auto-pay amounts, or lack of clear communication about adjustments, which can further complicate payments.\n",
            "\n",
            "These problems can cause several issues:\n",
            "- **Financial Planning Difficulties:** Sudden increases in payments can strain your budget and make it hard to plan financially.\n",
            "- **Confusion and Uncertainty:** Lack of clear information about why payments changed or how they are applied can cause frustration and uncertainty.\n",
            "- **Increased Loan Balances:** Improper application of payments, such as payments during forbearance, can sometimes result in balances not decreasing as expected or even increasing.\n",
            "- **Potential for Missed or Late Payments:** The complexity and lack of transparency might lead to missed payments, which can negatively impact your credit and loan standing.\n",
            "- **Extended Repayment Period and Higher Total Interest:** Changes without proper re-amortization or understanding can lead to longer repayment terms and more interest paid over the life of the loan.\n",
            "\n",
            "Overall, frequent servicer changes, delayed re-amortization, and unnotified payment adjustments make it difficult to keep track of your payments and ensure they are correctly applied.

            "Reference: There is a lot of student loan servicing confusion after the federal student loan forbearance program ended because borrowers are receiving conflicting information about who their loan servicer is, as seen when studentaid.gov lists Nelnet as the issuer but Nelnet says it is someone else. This confusion makes it hard for borrowers to know where to make payments, leading to concerns about extra interest or late fees. Additionally, after the forbearance ended, payments were not re-amortized right away, causing sudden increases in payment amounts, which adds to the confusion and stress for borrowers.\n",
            "Reference Contexts: ['<1-hop>\\n\\nAccording to Studentaid.gov, Im to get an email and a letter of notice that my servicer is being changed. studentaid.gov says that my issuer is nelnet. Nelnet says my issuer is somewhere else. With that said, the only reason i would have know would be because i am trying to make a payment. Now im going to incrue extra interest and my i have no idea where my loan is. This is ridiculous and I would really like to know where it is. Nelnet messages told me that as I logged in today XX/XX/year>, but nothing else. \\n\\nIf i incrue any late payment or interest fees, I will sue. This is absurd.', \"<2-hop>\\n\\nThe federal student loan COVID-19 forbearance program ended in XX/XX/XXXX. However, payments were not re-amortized on my federal student loans currently serviced by Nelnet until very recently. The new payment amount that is effective starting with the XX/XX/XXXX payment will nearly double my payment from {$180.00} per month to {$360.00} per month. I'm fortunate that my current financial position allows me to be able to handle the increased payment amount, but I am sure there are likely many borrowers who are not in the same position. The re-amortization should have occurred once the forbearance ended to reduce the impact to borrowers.\"]\n"

            "Response: There is so much confusion surrounding student loan servicing after the end of the federal student loan forbearance program due to several factors. First, there have been issues with communication and transparency from loan servicers, such as Nelnet and MOHELA, leading borrowers to be unaware of changes to their loan status, repayment obligations, or account transfers. Some borrowers received conflicting or incomplete information—such as claims of extended forbearance periods or being told they are still in forbearance until far in the future, often without any written confirmation.\n",
            "\n",
            "Second, the resumption of payments and loan transfers have not been well coordinated or clearly communicated, resulting in problems like misreported account statuses on credit reports, unexpected repayment amounts, or unnotified loan transfers to different servicers, with borrowers having to navigate multiple websites to find their loan information.\n",
            "\n",
            "Third, many borrowers experienced difficulties in accessing their accounts or receiving timely customer support, which exacerbates confusion and stress, especially when they are unsure about their loan status or how to make payments correctly.\n",
            "\n",
            "Overall, the combination of inconsistent communication, lack of clear notifications, and administrative errors has contributed to widespread confusion among borrowers regarding their student loans after the forbearance program ended.\n",

            "Response: Aidvantage assigned you an incorrect monthly payment amount on your Income-Driven Repayment (IDR) plan despite your income qualifying for a lower payment because it appears there was a systemic error or miscalculation on their end. Several complaints indicate that Aidvantage has repeatedly billed borrowers an amount that does not align with their documented income and eligibility for a lower payment under the IDR guidelines.

            "Response: It sounds like you're experiencing confusion and frustration due to discrepancies between the information from studentaid.gov and Nelnet regarding the location and status of your student loan. This situation can be complex because federal student loans often transfer between different servicers, and communication about these transfers isn't always clear or timely.\n",
            "\n",
            "Here are some points to consider:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Loan Servicer vs. Issuer**: \n",
            "   - The \"issuer\" generally refers to the original lender or the department that issued the loan.\n",
            "   - The \"servicer\" is the company that manages your loan account day-to-day, including billing and payments.\n",
            "   - Sometimes, the department may list a specific servicer on official platforms like studentaid.gov, but your account might have transferred to another servicer (e.g., Nelnet).\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Why the Discrepancy?**\n",
            "   - The Department of Education (via studentaid.gov) might show Nelnet as your current servicer because of a recent transfer.\n",
            "   - Nelnet might be indicating a different contact point or have different records.\n",
            "   - Lack of clear communication or delays in updating records can cause these mismatches.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **What You Can Do:**\n",
            "   - **Verify Your Loan Details**: Request your **Official Loan Statement** or **Loan Account Summary** directly from the Department of Education or through their official portal.\n",
            "   - **Contact the Department of Education**: Ask for confirmation of who your current official loan servicer is and the exact account details.\n",
            "   - **Request Proof of Communication**: Since you haven't received notifications, ask Nelnet for proof that they attempted to contact you (emails, letters, calls), including the addresses or numbers used.\n",
            "   - **Update Your Contact Info**: Confirm that your contact details are current and correct with the proper servicing agency once you identify the correct one.\n",
            "   - **Make a Payment**: If you want to pay the loan now to avoid accruing extra interest or late fees, be sure to make it through an official portal or confirmed contact method once you've identified the correct servicer.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Handling Potential Interest and Fees:**\n",
            "   - If late fees or interest have accumulated due to lack of communication, you can dispute these charges once you establish that you were not properly notified.\n",
            "   - Keeping records of your communications and payments can help support your case.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Summary**: Your best course of action is to confirm the actual current servicer and loan holder directly through the Department of Education, request official documentation for your loan account, and communicate with that official source to clarify any discrepancies. This will help you locate your loan and avoid unnecessary interest or fees.\n",
            "\n",
            "If you continue to experience difficulties, considering assistance from a student loan advisor or a legal advocate familiar with federal student loans might be helpful.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Note:** I don't have access to your personal loan records, so I cannot determine exactly where your loan is. But following these steps should help you locate your loan and resolve the communication issues.\n",
            "Retrieved Contexts (<class 'list'>): ['According to Studentaid.gov, Im to get an email and a letter of notice that my servicer is being changed. studentaid.gov says that my issuer is nelnet.

This is absurd.', 'On XX/XX/XXXX, I received an email saying my credit score dropped. When I opened my banking app, I saw that my credit dropped XXXX points overnight. I saw that the Department of Education was named on the loans, so I called the Dept. of Ed. on the XXXX. I talked to XXXX, asking about the loans, as I was unaware of any more student loans linked to my account because I did not see any loans on my Firstmark Services account where I had been paying off {$30000.00} in student loans. I made my last payment in XXXX of XXXX to pay off the {$30000.00} debt. XXXX told me it could be fraud and suggested I ask for forbearance until I could get the loans disputed. On XX/XX/XXXX, I called Firstmark Services to see if I could get any information about the other student loans that seemed to be causing the drop in my credit score. I saw no additional or unpaid loans on my Firstmark account. XXXX at Firstmark Services said that the loans causing the issue may be linked to the federal student loan servicer Nelnet. I then called Nelnet to ask about the loans and to verify if they were legitimately my student loans or if this was a case of fraud. XXXX from Nelnet told me the loans were linked to XXXX XXXX and XXXX University, both institutions I attended. She verified the dates the loans were taken out, which match the dates of my attendance. She told me I owe {$33000.00} total according to the Nelnet account. She said {$2800.00} of interest has accrued at this point. I also have late fees attributed to this account, which is why my credit dropped. She said the payments were due on XX/XX/XXXX. I asked her why I had never received a notification from them. She said they had sent an email, but upon further investigation, we found that the email was incorrect. I asked her why she never sent me a piece of physical mail or called my phone number to inform me about the loans, and she said she could only send an email despite having my home address and phone number. She then told me there was nothing they could do to help me, so I filed a dispute with Nelnet on XX/XX/XXXX. After filing an initial complaint through the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, I received a generic response from Nelnet on XX/XX/XXXX claiming they had reached out to me via phone and email prior to my payments becoming late. However, the response did not clarify where these emails were sent, or which phone number was called. I request that Nelnet provide proof of these communications, as I had never received any phone calls, emails, or letters from Nelnet until I shockingly discovered my credit score had dropped dramatically last month for what seemed to be no reason. Nelnet had not notified me of the late fees, and I do not know when they would have ever notified me if I had not investigated my credit score issue. By the time I uncovered the cause of my credit score drop, late fees and interest had already accumulated on my loans. Let me be clear : I received no communication from Nelnet until after I filed my complaint in XX/XX/XXXX, and as a result, I had no way of making timely payments on these loans. For context, I can provide proof of my history with Firstmark Services, where I consistently paid my loans on time and early. I can also provide evidence that I have always paid my car payments in full and on time I submit these facts as supporting evidence that I had no access to my student loans held with Nelnet, and if I had, they would have been paid on time. Additionally, since Firstmark is a division of Nelnet, I would also like an explanation as to why Nelnet did not send communications to the active email address associated with my Firstmark Services loans, which were being properly paid. If Nelnet had access to my Firstmark loan information and contact details, it is negligent that they did not use this information to ensure I was contacted through methods I would have received. I am employed and have no intention of avoiding my student loan responsibilities. However, Nelnets failure to provide me with access to my account has led to the accumulation of late fees and interest, significantly impacting my credit score. If I had been able to access my loans, I would have made timely payments, accrued less interest, and avoided these late fees. Nelnet did not respond to my complaint with adequate information and again was negligent in providing me with the information needed to access and pay off my student loans. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a new response from Nelnet. Unfortunately, this response failed to address any of the concerns I previously raised. I would like to outline the shortcomings of the response in addressing my claim below : \" XXXX authorized the transfer of your federal student loans from Great Lakes XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) to Nelnet, on XX/XX/XXXX. We have included a copy of the Welcome Letter that was sent on XX/XX/XXXX. \\'\\' This portion of the letter does not clarify the address to which the Welcome Letter was sent. I am requesting the specific address to which this letter was dispatched, as well as confirmation that I received it. Additionally, I want to highlight that the Welcome Letter Nelnet attached to the claim response appears to be from a webpage or email, but there is no proof that it was actually sent to any of my addresses, either physical or email. \" While your loan was in repayment, we sent you billing statements each month. When your account became past due, we also tried to reach you in other ways such as calling and sending both email and postal mail to help bring your account up to date. \\'\\' This section fails to specify which email address, phone number, or mailing address was used to contact me during the repayment period and when my account became past due. I have previously requested dates of contact, proof of the addresses used to reach me, and evidence of my acknowledgment of the billing statements. \" Per your promissory note, it is your responsibility to update your contact information to ensure that you receive important communications regarding your student loan account. \\'\\' I would like to emphasize that I was unable to update my contact information on an account I was unaware of, nor did I know that such a website existed for this purpose. Finally, the latest response I received claimed to attach a Master Promissory Note stating my responsibility to make payments despite never receiving a bill. The Master Promissory Note was never attached to the response. I have never seen this Master Promissory Note and have yet to receive such a document from the company.', \"XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX : XXXX. \\n\\nI have been calling Nelnet for years now, trying to get my loan discharged per the department of Education directions. My last email on XX/XX/XXXX states Nelnet was sent my paperwork and they are to discharge my loan and repay any monies owed ( if applicable ). Nelnet says they didn't get any paperwork and can't help me. Nelnet, has not only, NOT helped me with my loan but they have hung up on me during my calls, and tell me I have to go back the. The dept of education. Which I did and they told me to go back to Nelnet. Finally y, I filed a formal complaint about Nelnet to the department of education and they said someone would be assigned to my case and help me get my loan discharged. They assigned a Nelnet individual who just told me to call Nelnet back .. Again! My loan is now past due and I was instructed not to pay it by the department of education. I am trying to buy a house but this hangs oulver my credit and now showing late payments. Please someone help me fix this.

I then began to get emails from Nelnet about the {$22000.00} that I had borrowed. I immediately contacted them to inquire as to the amount and then is when I had to make a many, many phones calls to XXXX and Nelnet to track down the issue. Again, the ERROR was found to be with XXXX and was fully admitted on their part. I was informed that they were returning their mistake ( Loan # 1 ) and that there was no further action needed on my part. As it turned out, my daughter earned additional scholarships and worked thorughout the summer and fall and we did NOT use ANY of the Loan # 2 and I returned all of it in XX/XX/XXXX and have a letter from Nelnet stating that the loan was repaid in full and without penalty because it was within 6 months. \\nLast week, XX/XX/XXXX I received an email from Nelnet stating that I owe {$320.00} in principal and interest from Loan # XXXX - XXXX XXXX 's error! I then spent countless hours calling XXXX, XXXX and even the Department of Education to resolve this matter. I was told from Nelnet and Dept of Ed that neither one had control of the loan and to contact the other entity. XXXX ignored my request to discuss the matter and instead sent me this link to file a complain. \\nIn a nut shell, I am being asked to pay {$320.00} for money that was NEVER USED! Yes, the request ( XXXX ) was processed, the first time erroneously and WITHOUT my ever knowing it and the second time I returned it within 2 months! I did my due diligence, I spent hours tracking down their mistake, was told that it was taken care of and yet, I am stuck with a {$320.00} bill for money that NEVER even applied/used/withdrawn etc. \\nPlease help me resolve this! I thought I had taken care of everything and yet, it continues. XXXX has not offered any help even though they are solely responsible and Nelnet keeps telling me they don't have anything to do with the loan which I can not understand their position since they issued the loan! \\nPlease, I am not trying to get away with anything, my wife and I have helped our children ( ironically three of them went to XXXX ) and they have worked their tails off academically and over the summers so that we would never have to borrow money.

            "Response: The confusion stemming from conflicting information about loan servicers and lack of proper notification about servicer changes significantly harms the process and accuracy of Income-Driven Repayment (IDR) recertification. When borrowers do not receive clear, timely disclosures about changes in their servicers—such as notices from studentaid.gov versus information from the servicers themselves—they may be unaware of where their loans are hosted or who is handling their repayment plans. This lack of transparency can lead to missed communications, delayed processing of recertification applications, and errors in account records.\n",

            "Such issues are illustrated in complaints involving both Nelnet and Aidvantage. For instance, borrowers report not being properly informed about servicer changes or experiencing difficulty in obtaining accurate information regarding their loan status and repayment obligations. When borrowers are uncertain about their loan servicer or do not receive notifications about recertification deadlines or servicer switches, they risk unintentional missed payments, incorrect payment plans, and delays in achieving loan forgiveness under IDR terms.\n",
            "\n",
            "Conflicting information can also impede the recertification process itself because borrowers may not understand how to properly resubmit documents, or they may face difficulties confirming that their payments are correctly counted toward forgiveness milestones.
